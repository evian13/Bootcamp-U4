       "'[Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818]\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\nSir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,\\nfor his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;\\nthere he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a\\ndistressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and\\nrespect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;\\nthere any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs\\nchanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over\\nthe almost endless creations of the last century; and there,\\nif every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history\\nwith an interest which never failed.  This was the page at which\\nthe favourite volume always opened:\\n\\n           \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\n\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,\\nborn June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,\\nNovember 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\n\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands;\\nbut Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth--\\n\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles\\nMusgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\"\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\nhe had lost his wife.\\n\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,\\nin the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments,\\nexertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year\\nof Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with\\nthe arms and motto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county\\nof Somerset,\" and Sir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\n\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of\\nthe second Sir Walter.\"\\n\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character;\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome\\nin his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\nFew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion.\\n\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.\\n--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\nShe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\nclose by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\nLady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters.\\n\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years\\nhad passed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\nthe other a widow.\\n\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\nBe it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\nFor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had succeeded,\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\nmost happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.\\nMary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\nMrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--\\nshe was only Anne.\\n\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all;\\nbut it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\nto excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\nAll equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\nElizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\n\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\nabout Lady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\nLady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\nThirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  She had\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\nand pushed it away.\\n\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\nthe remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter\\nElliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\n\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\nHe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death,\\nSir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\nMr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\nand Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\nThe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth.\\n\\nSir Walter has resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\"\\nhe observed, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\nthe House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\nas Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased.\\n\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval\\nof several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\nElliot\\'s eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\nYet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\nThe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\nThis could not be pardoned.\\n\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.\\nShe knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\nMr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,\\nbut not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\nfrom his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?\\nDoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\nHe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\n\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\n\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\nShe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\nShe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  Herself the widow of\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\nand Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\nvery dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,\\nas being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\n\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\nand that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\nWhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\nhave done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\nas it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.\\nWe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\nhis friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\nShe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated\\nLady Russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\nthan to half a reformation.  Her knowledge of her father\\nand Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\nthrough the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\n\\nHow Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence.  Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all:\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort\\nof life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--\\ncontractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner\\nquit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s retrenching,\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him\\nthat Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\nIn any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house\\nin the country.  All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\nA small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\nLady Russell\\'s society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object\\nof her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\nShe disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\nand Bath was to be her home.\\n\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath\\nover London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\nof Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes.\\nIt would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne\\'s\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\n\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\nby passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,\\ntoo little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society\\nwould improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.\\n\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\nwhich stronger heads than Sir Walter\\'s have found too much.\\nKellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\n\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\nthe additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\nat Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\nthat Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\n\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\nthan because Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\nagainst previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\nbut always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\\nthis selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\n\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\n\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd\\none morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be\\nall wanting a home.  Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\nMany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  If a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\\n\\n\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter;\\n\"that\\'s all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\never so many before; hey, Shepherd?\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  Therefore, Sir Walter,\\nwhat I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,\\nmight conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\nI venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\nin the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\n\\nSir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\nnothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay\\'s health as a drive to Kellynch:\\n\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\nThe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now.  You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\n\\n\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\\nto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\nThe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\nis another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,\\nI assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"In all these cases, there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\nYour interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\nI venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.\"\\n\\nHere Anne spoke--\\n\\n\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\"\\nwas Mr Shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.\\nA man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\nany other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company\\nwith two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;\\nLord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\nwithout bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,\\nand a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `In the name of heaven,\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\n(Sir Basil Morley).  `Old fellow!\\' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin.\\nWhat do you take his age to be?\\'  `Sixty,\\' said I, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\n`Forty,\\' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.\\'  Picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.\\nI never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\nbut to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin\\'s age.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\nHave a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\\nThe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\nI have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\nSoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\neffect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\nI know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\nSir Walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,\\nhe had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.\\nBy the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,\\nAdmiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\nand had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\nMr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,\\nand understanding his (Mr Shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\nand mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,\\nI believe, several years.\"\\n\\n\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\nif Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the Admiral\\'s family, which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  A house was\\nnever taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\nA lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over.\\n\\n\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\\nand taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\\nwith business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\\nshe told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at Monkford.  Bless me! what was his name?\\nAt this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.\\nPenelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at Monkford:  Mrs Croft\\'s brother?\"\\n\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember\\nno gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"\\n\\n\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\\nI remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\\ncaught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nAfter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.\\nHe had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,\\nfor two or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.\\nYou remember him, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.\\nYou misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.\\nOne wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\\nno service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\nthey had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of Sir Walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nIt succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\nhe was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\nand authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained\\nat Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nSir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\nin all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\nSo far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing, in the Admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\"\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;\\na Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\na note of explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence,\\nand, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\\nIn all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence.\\n\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\\nwith a gentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps,\\nmay be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,\\nhis brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,\\nin the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\\nfor half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\nand Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\nand feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\nThey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\ndeeply in love.  It would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\nhaving them accepted.\\n\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\nTroubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\nHe thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nAnne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few,\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\nyouth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\nBut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\nHe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\nSuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;\\nbut Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\nShe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nSuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\nAnne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\nbut Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\nof success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had left the country\\nin consequence.\\n\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended Anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\nHer attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\n\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\nin change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  No one had ever\\ncome within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\nFrederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  No second attachment,\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\naround them.  She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had\\nlamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\nonly to Sir Walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\nand however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,\\nwhile Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\nBut in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\nand though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for Anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nThey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of Anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame\\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\nShe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,\\nall his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\nHe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\nHe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\nShe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\nshe could not hear that Captain Wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\nto live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\nShe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\\nand their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority\\nof Lady Russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft\\'s really\\ntaking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\n\\nThe sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards.\\n\\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s seeing Kellynch Hall,\\nAnne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell\\'s,\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\n\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\nand decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\non the Admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by Mr Shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\nto the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\n\\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\nand Mr Shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\n\"This indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\nand the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.\\nThe Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be\\nno harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\nesteemed about equal.\\n\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nLady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\\nof Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others.\\n\\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\nMary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\nUppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\ninstead of going to Bath.\\n\\n\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning;\\nand Elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay,\\nfor nobody will want her in Bath.\"\\n\\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nThis invitation of Mary\\'s removed all Lady Russell\\'s difficulties,\\nand it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\\ntill Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\\n\\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, Mrs Clay\\'s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,\\nin Mrs Clay\\'s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\n\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.\\nWith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope\\nof success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\n\\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\nand as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\nI can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,\\nI really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were\\na very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor\\nMrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\nthough I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her\\'s\\nand those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\nbut he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice\\nMrs Clay\\'s freckles.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne,\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\nalter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\n\\nAnne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\n\\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\\nMiss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.  The party drove off in very good spirits;\\nSir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\\nand Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\\nto the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\nand be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,\\nand Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage\\nof Lady Russell\\'s journey.\\n\\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old English style, containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\nfor his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,\\nFrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nHere Anne had often been staying.  She knew the ways of Uppercross\\nas well as those of Kellynch.  The two families were so continually meeting,\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house\\nat all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;\\nbut being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course.  Though better endowed than the elder sister,\\nMary had not Anne\\'s understanding nor temper.  While well, and happy,\\nand properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely.  She had no resources\\nfor solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  In person, she was\\ninferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\\nthe dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  She was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\\nand two children; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.\\nI am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning!\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\\nat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\\nas I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\nand not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.\\nI do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nAnne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\n\"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\nHe would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\nI assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind\\na word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.\\n\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours\\nat the Great House?\"\\n\\n\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,\\nexcept Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,\\nnot one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit\\nthe Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves\\nout of their way.\"\\n\\n\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\nIt is early.\"\\n\\n\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\nYou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:\\nand besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,\\nhave had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\\nleft Kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect\\nin a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\nI have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth\\'s plants\\nare for Lady Russell.  I have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\nand one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\nI was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up\\na great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  It would have been strange\\nif I had not gone.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were\\nso crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\nand Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into\\nthe back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non Anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on Mary\\'s.  She could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it,\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the Great House before they have\\nbeen to see you?\"\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.\\n\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\\nso well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\nThey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\nneither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old\\nEnglish style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\nTheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\nAnne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nThey were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the Great House family, which was generally,\\nas Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe Miss Musgroves, at Mary\\'s particular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\nShe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\nor without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\nwhich at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:\\n\"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\n\"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\nQueen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--\\n\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at Bath!\"\\n\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.\\n\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\nWith the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\nand all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.\\n\\nShe had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\nAnne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\nHe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to Anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\nfor a happy couple.  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\nfor while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them\\nvery well, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\nAnne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\nbut when listening in turn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils\\nthe children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\"\\n\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\nKnown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\n\"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\nwas Charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:\\n\"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,\\nyou might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse\\nthan I ever own.\"\\n\\nMary\\'s declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House,\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.\\nThey are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,\\nin general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\nbut Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\nBless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\nI otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\"  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\nI meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\nAnd on Mrs Musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for I know it would not do;\\nbut I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things\\nto rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\nI hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\nmy own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\nMrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\n\\nAgain, it was Mary\\'s complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\nat the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\nAnd one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\n\"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\nIt is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\nbut I know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\n\\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\nHer own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\nby being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary\\'s ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\nwas rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\nas she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\nExcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\nIn music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\nand Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\nfor her own.\\n\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\\nThe neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\nThere were more completely popular.\\n\\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\nwho depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\\n\"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nSo passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne\\'s heart\\nmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this\\nthe day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not\\nthink of it before.  How low it makes me!\"\\n\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\nto be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\n\"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked Charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\nAnne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\nShe wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned.  They came:  the master of the house\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\nthat Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nMrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\nShe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nHer manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\nAnne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\nof any sort.  She was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\nMrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\\n\\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\nwhen Mrs Croft\\'s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\nthat Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,\\nand not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\npresent state with proper interest.\\n\\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\nshe heard the Admiral say to Mary--\\n\\n\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say\\nyou know him by name.\"\\n\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\nShe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\nwhen the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\nwas the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\nwhen Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\nI am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\nof poor Richard!  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\nthat her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\nthat Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\npoor Richard\\'s captain at one time; I do not know when or where,\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\nand of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\n\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\nby calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\nunfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\nCaptain Frederick Wentworth\\'s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\n\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\nof the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\\nMr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\n\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\nfrom Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne\\'s nerves.\\nShe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\nSince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\n\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nA very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,\\nand Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\nand he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,\\nby the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment\\nto Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,\\nin Anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove\\'s civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\nShe and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child\\'s situation\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\n\\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\nIt was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nHer brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\nTill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\nthe information of Captain Wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\nmore full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\\n\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\nand Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\nto give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\nBut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\\nCharles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\nIt must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\nand Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\nThis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father\\nvery much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\n\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me\\nquite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.\\nYou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nMary knew, from Charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\nShe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\nbut as soon as there was only Anne to hear--\\n\\n\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\nI knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\nand Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\nTalks of his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\nI did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,\\nI am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all\\nequal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\\nof the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson\\'s directions,\\nand have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.\\nNursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\nA sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know\\nthat I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,\\nfor I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\nand you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think\\nCharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\nI am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.\\nI was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\\nto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,\\nI may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?\\nand it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\nare a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;\\nI am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,\\nindeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.\\nYou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\nis the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\nI should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child.\"\\n\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation, which began with Mary\\'s saying,\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\n\\n\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home\\nthan you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\nI should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\nAnne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\nIt is Anne\\'s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be\\na great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and I should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\nif Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\nagreeable to others?\\n\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\nPerhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\nHe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\n\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\nin Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\nin Mrs Charles Musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles\\'s being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\n\\nAnne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\n\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\nCharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;\\nhis sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\nand though Charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\n\\nMary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.\\nIn two minutes after Charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth\\'s,\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\nthe Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\nand Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\n\\n\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\\n\\nMary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.\\nThey had met.  They had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\nEight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\nHow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\\neight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part\\nof her own life.\\n\\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like\\nwishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\n\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\nfor, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was\\nso attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\nwhen they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\n\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\n\\n\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent,\\ndeep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\nlet him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\nShe had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.\\n\\n\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\nmake her happier.\\n\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\nHe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\nhad spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.\\nShe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\nconfident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.\\nIt had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been\\nweakness and timidity.\\n\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him\\nwas gone for ever.\\n\\nIt was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on shore,\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\nexcepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\nAnybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\nA little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\nand I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\n\\n\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior\\nI shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\\nI shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together\\nat Mr Musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\"\\n\"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\nAnne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\nThere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!\\nNow nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,\\nperhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\nNow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\nnever become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\nwhich reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\nof Mrs Musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,\\nI dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nAnne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\nshe found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.\\nI was the last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.\\nReported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off\\nto the West Indies.\"\\n\\nThe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nBut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,\\nyou would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\n\\n\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\nIt was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\na very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\nto be afloat again.\"\\n\\n\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\nAh! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.\\nI knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\nor that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate\\nI wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\nWe had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\npoor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation\\nnot having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,\\nand I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne\\'s shudderings\\nwere to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\n\\n\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there\\nhe met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\n\"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\nI always forgot.\"\\n\\n\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\nCharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\n\\n\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I\\nmade money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!\\nYou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.\\nExcellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,\\nso much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,\\nwhen I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget\\nwhat you did.\"\\n\\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\nof poor Richard.\"\\n\\n\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\nAh! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\nI assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\nwhich convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\n\\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.\\nIt was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\nand while the agitations of Anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\nA large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\\nwhich taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\n\\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\nnow came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\\nand her daughters.\"\\n\\n\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\nThere can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nThis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you. --All idle refinement!\\n--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.\\nI believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare\\nI have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\"\\n(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of\\nthe ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,\\nand three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that I could, and I would bring anything\\nof Harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine\\nthat I did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\\nand all her family to Plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\nWe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\nhe will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,\\nand a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married\\npeople begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,\\nwhen you are married.\\'  I can only say, `No, I shall not;\\' and then\\nthey say again, `Yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nHe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\\nto Mrs Croft.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\nthough many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic\\nfour times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\nCork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.  But I never went beyond the Streights,\\nand never was in the West Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,\\nyou know, the West Indies.\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\n\\n\"And I do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\nWhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\nand I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing\\nto be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered\\nin body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,\\nwhen the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.\\nI lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\nor when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\nnothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\\nMrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,\\nfor Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nThe evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,\\nAnne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\nof all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\nIf he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\nwho could wonder?\\n\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?\\nThe answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\nShe had rather play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too,\\nhe spoke to her.  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\nHis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe Admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  He had intended,\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\nof Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of Edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth\\namong the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth\\nvery much in the way.\\n\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth\\'s\\nintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\nonly two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money,\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,\\nbut it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove\\'s; and while\\nthe Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\nthe young Hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\nwith Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins.  Charles\\'s attentions to Henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;\\nbut from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne\\'s observation reached.\\nHenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\n\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different\\nat the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the Miss Musgroves\\' company, and Charles Hayter\\nhad but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\nCharles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\n\\nCharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\nhe had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\nHere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\nOh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should\\nrise to any very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!\\n`Lady Wentworth\\' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing,\\nindeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta\\nwould not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!\\nIt would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much\\nof your new creations.\"\\n\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;\\nand considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?\\nNothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove\\nof Uppercross.\"\\n\\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\n\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has\\na very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from\\nthe Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\npretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,\\nthat any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;\\nHenrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,\\nand Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\\nmarry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt\\nthat he has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.\\nI wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense\\nto say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.\\nBut Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you\\nwould have thought as I did, unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me.\"\\n\\nA dinner at Mr Musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\nof indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding\\nCaptain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nAs to Captain Wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\nthan that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.\\nEither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\ngood-humoured wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\\n\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\nwhen such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\nand obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.\\nThe advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\nof his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley\\'s\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,\\nbut had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:\\nshe was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\n\\n\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\\nI always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short,\\nyou know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nIs he coming, Louisa?\"\\n\\nOne morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,\\nat which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into\\nthe drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\nand could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:\\nMrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\nI dare say,\" had been Anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\nCaptain Wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nHe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\n\"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\\nthan Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.\\n\\nShe only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?\\nThe others will be here presently.\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\nthe newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nAnother minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nThere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\nbusy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.\\nShe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\nOnce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\n\\n\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome.\\nI am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\nDo not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to\\ncousin Charles.\"\\n\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir.\\n\\nIn another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\nbefore she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.\\n\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\nShe could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary\\nand the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\nand leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\\nthey were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\nIt was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his having said,\\nin a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth\\'s interference,\\n\"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\nand could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  But neither Charles Hayter\\'s feelings,\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\narranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\nfor while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.\\nThey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\nIt was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\nend in love with some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\nand yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\nAnne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\nShe did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\nany claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nAfter a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.\\nThree days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;\\na most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\nand having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nIt was Mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter\\nwas wise.\\n\\nOne morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the Mansion-house.\\n\\nIt was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\nMary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes,\\nI should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\"\\nAnne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\nthe Miss Musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\"\\nsaid Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing\\nthat I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\nif we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\nJust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\nTheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\n\\nAnne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\nShe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nIt was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\nmight fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.\\nLouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\nThis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\nof Louisa\\'s which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --\\n\\n\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.\\nI wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen\\nvery often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\\nas she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever\\nseparate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\nby anybody else.\"\\n\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\"\\nAnd there was silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\nblessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\ninto another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\"\\nBut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nWinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\nwhich parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nWinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nMary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\\nWell now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nHenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\nto do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\"\\ncried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly.\\n\\nCharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\nBut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\n\"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\n\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he\\nand Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\nto Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\nand saying to Captain Wentworth--\\n\\n\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,\\nI have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nShe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nThe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\nLouisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\nMary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\nwas sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  Anne found a nice seat\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\nMary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nAnne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\nCaptain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa\\'s voice was\\nthe first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech.  What Anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?\\nNo, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\\nmade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\nthe last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\nI see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,\\nyou have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\nYou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\nmay sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is a nut,\"\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not\\na weak spot anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\\n\"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\nIf Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nHe had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.\\nFor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\nWhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\nand they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, Louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\nand pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much\\nof the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.\\nI suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"When did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\\naccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nLady Russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  They think Charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,\\nand that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nThe sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\\nHer own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,\\nbefore she could move.  The listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character\\nwas considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation.\\n\\nAs soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\n\\nCharles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\nCharles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne\\ncould not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\nHenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\\nCharles Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\\n\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\nand least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles\\nand Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles\\'s other arm;\\nbut Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\nwith his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\nin being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\n\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft\\'s gig.\\nHe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\\nThe invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\n\"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room\\nfor three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might\\nsit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nAnne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral\\'s kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nYes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\nto give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\nThis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\nShe understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not\\nbe unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\nShe then found them talking of \"Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\\nsaid the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nAy, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have\\nsettled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;\\n\"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\nI had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always\\nbe company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;\\nI hardly know one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft,\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  One could not be\\nconnected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\n\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\nand Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\nand Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\nThis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\nat Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\nin leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.\\n\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\nCaptain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and\\nCaptain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.  They did not like each other,\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\nand she too little.\\n\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nThe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen\\nand unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\nA letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last,\\nhad brought intelligence of Captain Harville\\'s being settled\\nwith his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before, and Captain Wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\nand his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\n\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;\\nthough November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\nLouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,\\nLouisa, and Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\nbut to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\nthe middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\nfor going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  This was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove\\'s coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and Charles\\'s curricle, in which\\nhe drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nAfter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,\\nto make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,\\nCharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,\\nPinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\nIsle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\nto make the worth of Lyme understood.\\n\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.\\nCaptain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\nand he was to join them on the Cobb.\\n\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\nall well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,\\nand a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,\\non his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\nHe had been engaged to Captain Harville\\'s sister, and was now\\nmourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\npromotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.\\nShe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\nand sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,\\nthe friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\nand Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\nof Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick\\'s\\nstate of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick\\nwas very great.\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\nthan I have.  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\nHe is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\nyounger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nThey all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\na little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\nMrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\nbecause the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\nThe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\nof formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\n\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\nOn quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,\\nwere more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\nCaptain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\nCaptain Benwick.  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved.\\n\\nThey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\"\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\n\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in Captain Wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general.\\n\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne\\'s lot to be placed\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\nHe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\nand Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\nHe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion\\nor The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour\\nand The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\n\\nHis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\n\\nWhen the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nAnne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\nThey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\nbreeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\nthe sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,\\nlast spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\nNow, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely,\\nand fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?  Do not you agree with me,\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?\\nShe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\nmake it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\nin case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.\\nI really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation,\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\nMy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\nI must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\nDo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  And at Lyme too,\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\nShe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\nfelt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\n\"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate\\nwith Dr Shirley.  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  I always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\nbut I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat Uppercross.\"\\n\\nAnne was amused by Henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof Henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\non seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.\\nThey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\nbut Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\nThey were all at her disposal.\\n\\nWhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\nand stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;\\nand as they passed, Anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nShe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\nCaptain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you,\\nand even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\\n\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\nShe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\nBoth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\nIt was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\n\\nThey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party\\nto the window.  It was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\nsomebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne\\'s curiosity,\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\nfrom Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\nat dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath\\nand London.\"\\n\\n\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,\\nit must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see,\\njust as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!\\nIn the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the Kellynch family?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!\\nHeir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,\\nif it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive\\nhow extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\nWhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\nDo you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,\\nI was looking at the horses; but I think he had something\\nof the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!\\nOh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\nso it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\nsaid Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nWhen she could command Mary\\'s attention, Anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\nShe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\nthe second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\nquite ill-used by Anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,\\nthe next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nAnne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given\\nher father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\nshe suspected; and that Mr Elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\\nfell on Anne.\\n\\nBreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain\\nand Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off\\nfor Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\nsome time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\nCaptain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible;\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\nand you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\\n\\n\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\\njust made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\nhe sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.\\nThere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.\\nI would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia\\nhad come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest;\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\ntravelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off\\nto the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\nThat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\\nYou may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nMrs Harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\nBy all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\nnear the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\nall were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the Cobb.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron\\'s\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\nhe did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\nHe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined\\nI will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\nshe fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\nThere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around!\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\n\"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\nand in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain\\nBenwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\n\\n\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\nburst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\nall his own strength were gone.\\n\\n\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\nI can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\nand Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\nand everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;\\nwhile Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\\n\\nHe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\nwhen Anne eagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?\\nHe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nAs to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\nCaptain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate\\nbrother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give.\\n\\nAnne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\nwhich instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,\\nto assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?\\nWhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\\nMusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people\\nHenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,\\nand Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\n\\nThey were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.\\nCaptain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\nShocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\nThey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\nbeneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville\\'s direction,\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them.\\n\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\nMary, too, was growing calmer.\\n\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\nThey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\nThe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,\\nmay be conceived.\\n\\nThe tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered\\nby Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them.\\n\\nLouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\nas to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,\\ndid not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The Harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\nThey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\nThey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville\\'s care entirely.\\nMrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\nwas just such another.  Between these two, she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\n\\nCharles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\n\"Uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to Uppercross;\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\nAt first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\nEvery minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off\\nfor Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\\n\\nCharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\nHe would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\nSo far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.\\nShe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness\\nof her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa\\'s room,\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\nShe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\n\\nThe plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly\\ndown from Louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\n\\n\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,\\n\"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.\\nBut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,\\nI think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,\\nwish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,\\nso capable as Anne.\"\\n\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\nand she then appeared.\\n\\n\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply,\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor\\nin Louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville\\nwould but think so.\"\\n\\nOne thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable\\nthat Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\nand Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\nand leave Mr Musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of Louisa\\'s night.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was\\nmade known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\nShe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was\\nnothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\nto stay in Henrietta\\'s stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?\\nAnd to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!\\nNo, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne\\nwas inevitable.\\n\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\nfor the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick\\nattending to her.  She gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta\\'s schemes\\nfor Dr Shirley\\'s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had\\nfirst seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,\\nmade but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.\\n\\nShe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating\\nthe feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have\\nattended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nIn the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.\\nHow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\nIt was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only,\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\nwalk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!\\nBut so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\\n\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\nand limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character.\\n\\nThey got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\nAnne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn a low, cautious voice, he said: --\\n\\n\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not\\nappear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in\\nand break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nShe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\n\\n(End of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of Anne\\'s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\nwas spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\nin Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\nbeen difficulties.\\n\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was\\nmuch the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\nCharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\nmore particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\nespecially of Mrs Harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"She really left\\nnothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night.  Mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\nWhen he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\nthat Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\nIt would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,\\nand Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of\\ngetting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;\\nbut without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\nand found practicable so soon.\\n\\nThey were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all\\nthe minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,\\nand his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in Lyme.\\n\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters\\nfor one another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.\\nShe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.\\nThey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\nthey might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\n\\nShe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross\\nits cheerful character.  A few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nIf Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than\\nformer happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt,\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\nA few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\nall that was most unlike Anne Elliot!\\n\\nAn hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\non a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\nto make the sound of Lady Russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House,\\nor look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\nScenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.\\nIt stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\nShe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been.\\n\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell\\'s house\\nin September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress.\\n\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,\\neither Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell\\nfancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\n\\nWhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\nThe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\namong the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;\\nand when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still\\nbe with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,\\nthan her own father\\'s house in Camden Place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\nwith Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.\\nLady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\nlament the result, and Captain Wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\nAnne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.\\nShe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\nLady Russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.\\nWhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\n\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\nbe charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.\\n\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,\\nwhich found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\na rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,\\nLady Russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\n\"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.\\nAnne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\nIt will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nAnne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\nin observing--\\n\\n\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\nBy remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nShe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  These convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\nthat pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,\\n\"These rooms ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen\\nin their destination!  How unworthily occupied!  An ancient family\\nto be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\"\\nNo, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave.\\n\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\nthat Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time\\nsince the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot\\'s not being\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\nThis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done.\\n\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\nhow long Miss Musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\nThe Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\nis not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\ntruly!\"\\n\\nAdmiral Croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,\\nbut they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\\nrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.\\nBut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself),\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\nin the butler\\'s room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.\\nOne man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\nAnd so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\n\\nAnne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral,\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,\\nat Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.\\nThe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter\\nwhat we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.\\nI have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\nA very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:\\nbut I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\n\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\nSuch a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away\\nfrom one\\'s self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\nshifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\nthat I never go near.\"\\n\\nAnne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,\\npray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft\\'s, and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\nI grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,\\nwith my compliments.  He will be glad to hear it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.\\n\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe enough,\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s going than Anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\nand as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross\\nthey drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nThey had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had\\ngot Mrs Harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\nsupply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable.\\n\\nMary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\nCharles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\nthey dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\nand at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\nCharles laughed.\\n\\n\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is\\na very odd young man.  I do not know what he would be at.\\nWe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\nI thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had\\n`been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.\\nI suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\nI should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage\\nfor such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\nCharles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well\\nhow it really was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.)\\n\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered\\nthat Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\nand he had not courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour,\\nMary knows it is.\"\\n\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\nnot considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\nAnne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be\\nleft to be guessed.  Anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard.  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\nand continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\"\\nMary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him\\nmention Anne twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne,\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\nHis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,\\nbut it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta\\nall about it; and then `Miss Elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\nNow Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were\\nin the other room.  `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' Oh! there was no end\\nof Miss Elliot\\'s charms.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\nif he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart\\nis very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling.\\n\\n\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\nhe will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,\\nyou may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,\\nand I told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\nand I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\nSo, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\\n\\n\"Any acquaintance of Anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\nwas Lady Russell\\'s kind answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! as to being Anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy\\nto see Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma\\'am.\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\nHe is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him.\"\\n\\n\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like him.\\nI think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\\nHe is just Lady Russell\\'s sort.  Give him a book, and he will\\nread all day long.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think\\nLady Russell would like that?\"\\n\\nLady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she,\\n\"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\nas I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\nI wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.\\n\\n\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.\\nHis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nThis decision checked Mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the Elliot countenance.\\n\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going\\ndown to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\\nto go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.\\nLady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\nCaptain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it\\nthan Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\na week\\'s indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\n\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\nbringing with them Mrs Harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\nof Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\n\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,\\nwhen Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nThough neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,\\nnor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\nof the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,\\nduring their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nAnne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\nwhich Louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,\\nwho got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home.\\n\\nLouisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\\n\\n\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross\\nin the Christmas holidays.\"\\n\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\nrather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,\\nwas entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\nunder their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\n\\nAnne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\nof Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\nMr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful\\nif it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\nno wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\nbut she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.\\n\\nShe was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\nand both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I\\nleave you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\nand met her with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\n\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination\\nto listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\nall their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:\\nit was all Bath.\\n\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\nor the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after.  Everybody was wanting to visit them.\\nThey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nHere were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\nwho had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\nThey had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.\\nHe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\nHe had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath\\nin November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of\\nSir Walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\nin Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\nwas completely re-established.\\n\\nThey had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted\\nof being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\nHe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\n\\nThe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\nSir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough\\nBuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it.\\n\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\nShe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\nThere had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,\\nnot all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\nHere was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in Camden Place.\\n\\nAnne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nShe heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\nin Mr Elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\nto be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\nIn all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\nand the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\nA sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;\\nit was, perhaps, for Elizabeth\\'s sake.  There might really have been\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,\\nand when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth\\nwere his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\nand that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot\\'s frequent visits\\nwere talked of.\\n\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\\nThey did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\\nto her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;\\nSir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think\\nthat he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean\\nto complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of\\nthe whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\nand there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\nin Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\nSir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.\\nHe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  The worst of Bath was\\nthe number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\nHe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\nas he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\na tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!\\nthey were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\nHe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\nupon Colonel Wallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed\\nto escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\\nthat Colonel Wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\nas Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.\\n\"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not\\nhappen every day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\nand grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!\\nIt was ten o\\'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine\\nin Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.\\nMrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot\\'s knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.\\nWith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\nMr Elliot was ushered into the room.\\n\\nIt was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nAnne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\nmust follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\n\"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\n(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking\\nas he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  They were not the same,\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\n\\nHe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,\\nhe began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\nShe gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.\\nHis regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\nIf he had but asked who the party were!  The name of Musgrove would\\nhave told him enough.  \"Well, it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\nare more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world.  The folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.\\n\\nHis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\nHaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\nWhen he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\nShe could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\n\\nHe staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-\\npiece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\nbefore Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\nCamden Place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nThere was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot\\'s\\nbeing in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\nin love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay\\nto have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\n\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.\\nShe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say, \"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet,\\nyou have seen nothing of Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.\\nYou must not run away from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted\\nwith Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,\\nI well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised\\nto see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.\\nHer countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\nand promise to stay.\\n\\nIn the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\"\\nhe supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\nyou cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,\\nthe constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\nYou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must\\ntake its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\nif Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always\\ncommand a home with Lady Russell.\\n\\nLady Russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay\\nin such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\nas she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\"\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\nHe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\nHe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\nShe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis\\nsaid it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\\n\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\nIn Lady Russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\nand at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;\\ntime will explain.\"\\n\\nIt was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,\\nfelt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.\\nIn that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\nA little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,\\nAnne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nHowever it might end, he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\nas herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\n\\nThey did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance,\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\nand her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort\\nof No.--, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples\\n(in Anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\n\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\nall day long.\\n\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter\\'s\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.\\nNo letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\nHow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\nin a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\nthought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth preserving,\\ngood company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,\\nfor three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.\\nShe had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\nto his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.\\n\"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\nThe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  They visited\\nin Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\nand the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible:  and \"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin,\\nLady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nAnne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\\nbut for her birth.\\n\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\nthey had their value.  Anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\nthat is what I call good company.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\nthat is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\nBirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\nit will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.\\nShe is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin\"\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\\nWill it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,\\nthat they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride\\nthan any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\nIn London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\nit might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\nBut here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.\\nYou talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\nwould have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\na little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\n\"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nHe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\nand though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description.\\n\\nShe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\nof there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\\nnow Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nMiss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\nthat Anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nShe was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\n\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore\\nlost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\nor what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.\\nShe only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith\\'s lodgings\\nin Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nThe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\n\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\nand Anne\\'s astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith\\'s.  She had been\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\nHer accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\nYet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\nIt was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\n\\nThere had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,\\ncompared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\nShe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\n\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\nShe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\nShe always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody\\'s heart is open,\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,\\nsensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\n`the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\nCall it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour\\'s\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\nknow one\\'s species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\nTo me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nAnne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\n\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\nSuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\nAnd it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\nthough I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\nHere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\nThere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\nIt was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\n\\n\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.\\nShe has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all\\nthe high-priced things I have in hand now.\"\\n\\nAnne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\nof such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning\\nfrom Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\nin Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.\\nThey were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth\\nwas disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot\\nto be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;\\nand who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?\\nThat she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary,\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when I have\\ncalled on Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.\\n\"Sir Henry Russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\\nA poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\na mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\\n\\nMrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it\\nto himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\\nin Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\nand no surname of dignity.\\n\\nAnne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\nShe had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;\\nand Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,\\nand Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\nHer kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.\\nHe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell\\nin a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\n\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\nShe would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  Anne heard her,\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\nand gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell,\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\nI think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\nA most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\nI think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nLady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,\\nthe future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother\\'s self\\nin countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\nMy dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life!\"\\n\\nAnne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\nof having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself;\\nof being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\nLady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\nwhat Anne did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch\\nand of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.\\nAnd it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against Mr Elliot.\\n\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\nclear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,\\nif not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\nShe saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\nHow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\n\\nMr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\nThere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.\\nHer early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\nWarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,\\nstood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see\\nwhat Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\nMrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\n\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of\\nthe following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nIt was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,\\nwas growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.\\nShe wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.\\nIt was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew\\nthat Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be\\nrecovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s compliments.\\n\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.\\nThey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an introduction.\\nI should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.\\nI know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nAnne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\nthe poor Admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\nIt had been begun several days back.\\n\\n\\n            \"February 1st.\\n\\n\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.\\nYou must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had\\na very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.\\nThe holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,\\nexcept of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\nWhat dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\nI have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,\\nexcept Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\nBetween ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\\nas long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\nThe carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.\\nWe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\nMrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\nI am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted\\nwith him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\nto be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\\nwith Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\nLet me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children\\nto be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well,\\nfor a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\\nare going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.\\nCharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\nI do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\\n\\n  \"Mary M---.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\nvery much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa\\nbore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal\\nto add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,\\nand I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.\\nI shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.\\nI have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\nShe and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\nas well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\nNeither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,\\nand not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.\\nTrue, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.\\nMrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\nWe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;\\nand Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick\\nis expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\\nwill say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;\\nI never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,\\nof Captain Benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\nHow Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.\\nCertainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the Hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nMary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\nof the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter\\nwanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\\nas it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\n\"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\\n\\n\"They come on the Admiral\\'s account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft\\'s\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft\\nwill be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.\\nElizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\nWe had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.\\nThere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\nI am told, are sailors.  The Crofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\nin an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\nAnne was at liberty.\\n\\nIn her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,\\njoyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\nfeeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!\\nWhere could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.\\nIt had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta\\'s\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\nand Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\nand Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary\\nmight have allowed.  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.\\nHe must love somebody.\\n\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\nHe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of\\nLouisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\nof its being so.  The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate.\\n\\nThe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\nand if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\nto be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne\\'s heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.\\nShe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\nThey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\n\\nShe longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\nThe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove\\nwas mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,\\nperfectly to Sir Walter\\'s satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,\\nand considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\nThey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\nHe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.\\nLady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\nKnowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\nto see the Admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the Croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\nand return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.\\nThis is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,\\nstaring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping.\\nBut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\\nDid you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\nwhich they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\"\\n(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\nWell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere\\nfor you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you\\nas we go along.  There, take my arm; that\\'s right; I do not\\nfeel comfortable if I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\"\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;\\nI shall only say, `How d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.\\n`How d\\'ye do?\\'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nShe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her heels,\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the street,\\nyou will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby fellows,\\nboth of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nSophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:\\ngot away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story\\nanother time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.\\nLook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\nAh! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!\\nHow do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.\\nWe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\nand draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch,\\nay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.\\nWe do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.\\nThe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\n\\nWhen they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\nfor the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was\\nnot really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.\\nAs soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\nBut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\nI am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have\\nall been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been\\nhappening to.  Her Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\\n\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\\nif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,\\nthis Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.\\nHe was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right.  But even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on.  Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,\\nand then he went off to see Edward.  When we came back from Minehead\\nhe was gone down to Edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\nWe have seen nothing of him since November.  Even Sophy could\\nnot understand it.  But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;\\nfor this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being\\nto marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne,\\n\"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\\nHe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.\\nAn excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom Captain Benwick\\'s manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,\\nand I will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nAnne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\nnot at all to represent Captain Benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\nshe was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.\\nWe have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\nin a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.\\nI fancy they are all at Uppercross.\"\\n\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\n\"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain\\nWentworth\\'s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.\\nIt did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\nand Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\n\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\ntoo much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\"\\n\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,\\nand beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.\\nIt would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other\\nMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\nDo not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing\\nhis wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were\\nin Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in Lady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,\\nturned into Molland\\'s, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,\\nto request her assistance.  He soon joined them again, successful,\\nof course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nHer ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt\\nas to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also\\na mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne\\'s;\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\\nhad a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,\\nthat his cousin Anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\n\\nIt was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\nCaptain Wentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\nand absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\nit was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\nand Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street\\non a commission of Mrs Clay\\'s.\\n\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.\\nShe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.\\nShe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\nCaptain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\na little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\nhe looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\nShe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\nAll the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,\\nshe had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\na something between delight and misery.\\n\\nHe spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nAfter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\nTime had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness\\nof some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\\nof the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\nCaptain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nIt did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\n\\nLady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\nIt was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\\nMiss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\nand Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them.\\nThe carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer walking.\"\\n\\n\"But it rains.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday,\\nI have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\"\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,\\nif you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\n\\nShe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\nand adding, \"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.\\nCaptain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,\\nadmiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"Good morning to you!\"\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\n\\nAs soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth\\'s party\\nbegan talking of them.\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.\\nHe is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.\\nWhat a very good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\nto look at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess\\nI admire her more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! so do I.\"\\n\\n\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.\\nAnne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.\\nShe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,\\nand insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now\\nshe could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\n\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\nhe meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?\\n\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter\\nLady Russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\nin returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\nShe looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was\\nnot to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nLady Russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\\nof her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell\\'s mind,\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\nof one personal grace!\\n\\nAt last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she\\nspeak of him?\"\\n\\n\"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\nbut I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and\\nMrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\nand I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess\\nI can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\neither at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\nA day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\nfor the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\nIt was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.\\nOf course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,\\nand Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\\nLady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\nMrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nWho is your party?\"\\n\\nAnne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\n\"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\nto-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding\\nthat I may not have many more visits from you.\"\\n\\nAnne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nSir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door\\nopened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\nHe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\"\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\nTheir being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\\nThis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nAfter talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time.\"\\n\\nShe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\n\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\nWhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be\\na very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think,\\nends the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\nThe Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\nAll this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nHe stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne\\'s cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,\\nhe proceeded thus--\\n\\n\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\nbut Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;\\nand I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\nit would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\\nIt seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\nFanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\nEither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\nso far as to say--\\n\\n\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\\n\\n\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa\\'s doing well\\nwas quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.\\nShe would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.\\nThe country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;\\nand the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\\n\\n\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\nI should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne;\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\nOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\nby no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\nat Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nAs she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot\\nand Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was\\na group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.\\nShe was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\nShe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\ntowards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\nShe was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\nas being less happy than herself.\\n\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw\\nthat he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\na moment\\'s regret.  But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her,\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\n\\nUpon Lady Russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\nand proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\n\\nVery, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be\\nan insult to the nature of Anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\n\\nAnne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\nHer happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\na hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\nin only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\nat Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  Yes, some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less.  He must love her.\\n\\nThese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on,\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\nAnne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\nMiss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof Colonel Wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nAnne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\nat least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,\\nin the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained\\nthe words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\nfor certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend\\nto understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.\\nYou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;\\nand I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since\\nI came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family.\"\\n\\n\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\nNo one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\nis irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,\\nbut he would not tell.\\n\\n\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\nHe had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot\\'s company,\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\nVery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,\\nI would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nSuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\nHer father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air\\nthan one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;\\nCaptain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant\\nin Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\\n\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne\\'s eyes had caught\\nthe right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.\\nIt seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\n\\nWhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nMr Elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\\n\\nThe first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nHe did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again,\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\nTo Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\nShe could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nIn re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\nwas favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,\\nand Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\nand a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,\\nwithout comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed.\\n\\nSuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth\\nwas again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something\\nmust be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\\nwas strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,\\nof Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\nHe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain\\nWentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\nAnne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.\\nIt came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\nto explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\nA few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night;\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.\\nCaptain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it\\na week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nBut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\nHow was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?\\nHow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think\\nof Mr Elliot\\'s attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\nMr Elliot was almost a first object.\\n\\nShe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\nperhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.\\nHow she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\nher affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nPrettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\ncould never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne\\nwas sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.\\nIt was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\n\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne\\'s recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\\nwas well know by name to Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\nThey never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\\nin the room.\"\\n\\n\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\nwith the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,\\nI know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;\\nfor as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\nfor hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen\\nvery little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.\\nThere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\nand this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\n\\n\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nAnne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\nA blush overspread Anne\\'s cheeks.  She could say nothing.\\n\\n\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,\\n\"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time.\"\\n\\nAnne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\nhow any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.\\nAfter another short silence--\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\nDoes he know that I am in Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment\\'s reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\nmore composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.\\nHad I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.\\nI want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.\\nHe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\nof course it is done.\"\\n\\n\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\nI am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\nYou must consider me only as Mr Elliot\\'s relation.  If in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\nI beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.\\nI ought to have waited for official information,  But now, my dear\\nMiss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\\nNext week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\nMr Elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\nI assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.\\nI should like to know why you imagine I am?\"\\n\\nMrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew\\nwhat you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?\\nLet me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for\\nmy former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?\\nWhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\nLet me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly,\\n\"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\nDo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  Let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\nNinety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,\\nI hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,\\nand safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\nHe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.\\nI have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\nto do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\nI think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner\\nof speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\nSurely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\nShould he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you\\nI shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\\n\\nShe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed\\nno one in particular.\"\\n\\n\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in.  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday;\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.\\nShe had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\nShe sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\n\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make\\na very long history, I think, of one such little article\\nof unfounded news.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?\\nShall I take any message?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,\\nand under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,\\nI have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"I did.\"\\n\\n\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Intimately.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\nI have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.\\nWas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nThey were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers\\nI have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.\\nI have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.\\nThere were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\nEven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;\\nI think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith Mr Elliot\\'s real character.  Though I fully believe that,\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,\\nbe differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.\\nThose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\nHe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\nOh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nAnne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\nBut I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.\\nI will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.\\nHe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\nand thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,\\nbecame excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not\\nthink very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\nalways together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.\\nHe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\nhe had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\nMy poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse\\nwas open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot\\'s life,\"\\nsaid Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\nIt must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\nwhich I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\n\\n\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,\\nbut I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited\\nand encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\nI knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\nI was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\nI did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\nI have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.\\nHe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\nand I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\nI cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\nThat was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.\\nHe told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.\\nIt was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\nand that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\nspoke of me to Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nShe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\"\\ncried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.\\nI could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;\\nI have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\\nThe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\nto his character.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\\nWhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young,\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.\\nI think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what Mr Elliot was doing.  `To do the best for himself,\\'\\npassed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,\\nwas all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\nthrown by chance into Mr Elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\nwith respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\nDepend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\nHis chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\nbut I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\\non that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\nThis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\nI am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\n\\n\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;\\nstay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nAnne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\nThe box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\na small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.\\nThe letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\nBut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\nand when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\nHere it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad\\nthat I can produce it.\"\\n\\nThis was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\\nand dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --\\n\\n\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.\\nI wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\nAt present, believe me, I have no need of your services,\\nbeing in cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.\\nThey are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\nThe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\nhe is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse\\nthan last year.\\n\\n\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of Walter\\nI can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\nto be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\\n\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;\\nand Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\\nthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nBut it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\\nCan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\nyou were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"Can you really?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\nand I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,\\nbut I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.\\nHe truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:\\nhis friend Colonel Wallis.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\\nof his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\nbut Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\nShe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend\\nMrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.\\nWhen I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.\\nMr Elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\nThat was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when I arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\nNobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you\\nindeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without\\nknowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?\\nDid he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\'\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\n\\n\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.\\nI happened to be at Lyme.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\\nat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,\\nand from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive\\nin his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,\\nwhich I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\nwhom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\\nas long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter\\'s acquaintance,\\nof her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise\\nthat Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,\\nand she continued--\\n\\n\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\nvisit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,\\nthat time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot\\'s opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\nHe cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\nof coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\nMr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\nadded another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.\\nHe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\ncalled at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.\\nYou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\nI know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.\\nI have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\nI should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.\\nA scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\nbut my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `Why, to be sure,\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,\\nis a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter\\'s making a second match.\\nShe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through\\nMrs Wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.\\nMy line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\n\\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\nand Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\nMrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\nFrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\nThey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot\\'s regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\nurgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\nAnne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\nusual state of mind.\\n\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.\\nMr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\nShe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\nThis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\nwas hard to bear.\\n\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne\\'s good offices\\nwith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\nsince he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne\\'s feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliot\\'s character would allow,\\nwhen Anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at Mrs Smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him!\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\nI considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,\\nthan if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,\\nas I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\nHe was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.\\nBut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\nI was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\n\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\nwas, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.\\nThere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as\\nopposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\nPity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.\\nIn every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.\\nShe must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\n\\n\\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\nescaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\nso Mrs Clay says, at least.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  However, when I found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly.\\nMr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,\\nto turn her eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!\\nDear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  If you will have such\\nideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\nI did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.\\nWhen I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\\nthe sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise.\\n\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\nShe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\n\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable.\\n\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\\nhis return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.\\nIt was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\nIt was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay\\'s selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot\\'s\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\nShe saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.\\nOh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\nand pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\nYou need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.\\nI used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her\\nat the concert.  Something so formal and arrange in her air!\\nand she sits so upright!  My best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,\\nthat I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;\\nbut I shall only leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\nIf she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\nbut last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?\\nAnne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\nAfter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\nand \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\n\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\nbut Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\nThey were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were\\nat the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;\\nbut till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\nAnne could not draw upon Charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,\\nand Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by Captain Harville\\'s wanting to\\ncome to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed\\ncoming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had\\nsome old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\na good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.\\nMrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\\n\\nAnne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor Henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,\\nvery recently, (since Mary\\'s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\nquite as soon as Louisa\\'s.  \"And a very good living it was,\"\\nCharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.\\nIn the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get\\na special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\nhe observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That\\'s the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\nI hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should have\\ndaughters\\' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta\\'s match.\\nShe never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,\\nnor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;\\nand I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  They do everything\\nto confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\n\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\nand Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\nall day long.\"\\n\\nAnne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste,\\nI know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think\\nI am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.\\nWe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\nthat I have liked him the better ever since.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles\\'s\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs.\\n\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\nas they were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister,\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nElizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\nShe felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.\\nIt was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\nand then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:\\n\"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\nto give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\nand I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;\\nput her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  I will ask them all for an evening;\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\nThey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted\\nto come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,\\nbut most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\nMary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked\\nto meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;\\nand Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her\\nand Henrietta directly.\\n\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;\\nbut Anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\nand Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\nand on Charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\nhistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have\\nher moments of imagining.\\n\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with\\nCaptains Harville and Wentworth.  The appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  It was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\nTheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.\\nHe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\\n\"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  And yet,\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind.\\n\\n\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay,\\nI am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\nI saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed\\ndeep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.\\nIt is Mr Elliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.\\nHe was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nMary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne\\nto come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late\\nif you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.\\nHe is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have\\nforgot all about Lyme.\"\\n\\nTo pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\nAnne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,\\ncertainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,\\nor I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\n\\nThe visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.\\nI have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\nA\\'n\\'t I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nIt holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.\\nHave not I done well, mother?\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\nTake a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\nHow can you be so forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\nNever worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,\\nI think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,\\nbut I shall go to the play.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\n\\n\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n`happy.\\'  There was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.\\nWe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.\\nNothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\nWe are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention\\nis due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.\\n\"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,\\nI should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\nWhat is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,\\nwho saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.\\n\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back\\nand change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,\\nand we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on Mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\nI have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\n\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;\\nCharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\\n\\n\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.\\nI am no card-player.\"\\n\\n\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\n\"It is a period, indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne\\'s imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\nshould come in.\\n\\nThey were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\nwherewith to pity her.\\n\\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\nfor Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\nHow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nShe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nElizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\\nexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.\\n\"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\nIt was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,\\nthat Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\nThe past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,\\nand Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\nbut not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\nShe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"Only think of Elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered Mary\\nvery audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!\\nYou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nAnne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nThe party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\nAnne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose.\\n\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\nquestion, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\n\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in Mrs Clay\\'s face as she listened.  It was transient:\\ncleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature: --\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise\\nI met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.\\nHe turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\\nsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;\\nfor I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\nHe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\nHe was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that I have been\\nfull of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nOne day only had passed since Anne\\'s conversation with Mrs Smith;\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be\\nwith the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,\\nand Mr Elliot\\'s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade\\'s head,\\nmust live another day.\\n\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart,\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\nThe party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,\\nand Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard\\nthat Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,\\nno waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after\\nher entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\n\\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\nAnne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\nas Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\n\"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,\\nand what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\nto my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\nI said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\nit was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"And so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\nfor Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\nAt any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\n\"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against\\nfor my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\nan engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\nI hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\nbut Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\nher mind was in confusion.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him,\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\n\"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself\\nand went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  As she joined him,\\nCaptain Harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)\\n\"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our\\nwalking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--\\nbut no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with\\na clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\nand I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\nIt was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?\\nI hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\nover to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\nCaptain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\n\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\nIt is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.\\nWe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\nYou are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply\\nto Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall\\nwe say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  I will not allow it to be more\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\nor have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\nMan is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nNay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\nYou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\nYou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nYour home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\"\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\nadded to all this.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\nIt was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught.\\n\\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\\n\\n\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.\\nI am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,\\nand want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,\\nI suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.\\nBut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\nprose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think\\nI ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all\\nwritten by men.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\nin books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\nbeen in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nWe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\n\"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\nand then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\nAnd then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\nand saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\nas if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\nIf I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\nI speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\nwith emotion.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,\\nand by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\nI should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\nso long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\nan object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\nAll the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.\\nAnd when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\nTheir attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.\\n\\n\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.\\n\"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\nTo-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\n(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\nand I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;\\nand you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I\\nshall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,\\nI am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.\\nI shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\n\\nMrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how\\nto understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\"\\nfrom Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\nHe had passed out of the room without a look!\\n\\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\nplaced it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\nalmost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\nthe work of an instant!\\n\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost\\nbeyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\nto \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,\\nhe had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\n\\n\\n\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,\\nhalf hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\nand a half ago.  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.\\nUnjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,\\nbut never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.\\nFor you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?\\nCan you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even\\nthese ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have\\npenetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\nToo good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.\\nYou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\nBelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\\n\\n\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,\\nwill be enough to decide whether I enter your father\\'s house\\nthis evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half and hour\\'s solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.\\nAnd before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\nCharles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\\n\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\nShe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\nstir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\nshe said she would go home.\\n\\n\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\nI wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.\\nCharles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\\n\\nBut the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\ncould not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\nin the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\nfinding her better at night.\\n\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"I am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\nPray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\\nand Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.\\nCaptain Harville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\\nWill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\nYou will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville\\nanywhere, remember to give Miss Anne\\'s message.  But indeed, my dear,\\nyou need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,\\nI\\'ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\"\\n\\nAnne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,\\nhowever.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby Captain Harville.  Another momentary vexation occurred.\\nCharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\nthere was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\n\\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\nof Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\nAnne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\nand not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.\\nPresently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,\\nor farther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\\nBecause, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\nShe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\nand I ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the Market Place.\\nHe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\nthat I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.\\nBy his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\nwhich you shot with one day round Winthrop.\"\\n\\nThere could not be an objection.  There could be only the most\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\nIn half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\nand estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nShe had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\n\\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.\\nHe never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\nto be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\na sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at\\nCaptain Harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\n\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\nfor Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which Louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\nThere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\n\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof Louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,\\nI could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\nperhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour\\nif she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously\\non this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had\\nno right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls,\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\nill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\nif her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.\\nIt determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\nHe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\nI could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith Benwick.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;\\nI could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first\\nfive minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,\\' and I was.\\nWas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope?  You were single.  It was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help\\noften saying, `Was this for me?\\'\"\\n\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,\\nbut the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward\\nin the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot\\'s appearing\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\nwith energy.\\n\\n\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on\\nwithout agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\\nwas it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\nWhen I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\nin aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\\nof your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\nI had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit\\nwas to be added.\"\\n\\n\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,\\nI was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,\\nand I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nAt last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\nAn interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment.\\n\\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\nIt was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found\\nan evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\nMr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\nShe cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\nand with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;\\nand I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,\\nthat I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place\\nof a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\nand for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right\\nin submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,\\nbecause I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now,\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\\nto reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\nI trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned\\nto England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\nand was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,\\nwould you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\nbut I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.\\nI shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\nThis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\nI have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\nwith a smile. \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\nI must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and\\nan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\nSir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\n\\nSir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,\\nwhen he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour.\\n\\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\nand do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what\\nLady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth\\'s manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\nMr Elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less\\nfor Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes.\\n\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\nin others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nOf all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\nit was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\nAnne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.\\n\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\nShe had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nThe news of his cousins Anne\\'s engagement burst on Mr Elliot\\nmost unexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\nhis best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  But, though discomfited\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay\\'s\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in London, it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nMrs Clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of Sir William.\\n\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\n\\nAnne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell\\'s meaning\\nto love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity.  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\nLady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself.  Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\nhe could now value from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\nand as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently.\\n\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\nsecured her two.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\nand Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husband\\'s property in the West Indies, by writing for her,\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\n\\nMrs Smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\nShe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\nand yet be happy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits, as her friend Anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\nAnne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s affection.  His profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n        Finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'[Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,\\nfor his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;\\nthere he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a\\ndistressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and\\nrespect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;\\nthere any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs\\nchanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over\\nthe almost endless creations of the last century; and there,\\nif every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history\\nwith an interest which never failed.  This was the page at which\\nthe favourite volume always opened:\\n\\n           \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\n\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,\\nborn June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,\\nNovember 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\n\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands;\\nbut Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth--\\n\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles\\nMusgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\"\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\nhe had lost his wife.\\n\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,\\nin the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments,\\nexertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year\\nof Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with\\nthe arms and motto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county\\nof Somerset,\" and Sir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\n\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of\\nthe second Sir Walter.\"\\n\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character;\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome\\nin his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\nFew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion.\\n\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.\\n--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\nShe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\nclose by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\nLady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters.\\n\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years\\nhad passed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\nthe other a widow.\\n\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\nBe it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\nFor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had succeeded,\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\nmost happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.\\nMary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\nMrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--\\nshe was only Anne.\\n\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all;\\nbut it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\nto excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\nAll equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\nElizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\n\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\nabout Lady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\nLady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\nThirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  She had\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\nand pushed it away.\\n\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\nthe remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter\\nElliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\n\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\nHe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death,\\nSir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\nMr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\nand Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\nThe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth.\\n\\nSir Walter has resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\"\\nhe observed, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\nthe House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\nas Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased.\\n\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval\\nof several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\nElliot\\'s eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\nYet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\nThe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\nThis could not be pardoned.\\n\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.\\nShe knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\nMr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,\\nbut not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\nfrom his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?\\nDoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\nHe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\n\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\n\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\nShe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\nShe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  Herself the widow of\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\nand Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\nvery dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,\\nas being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\n\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\nand that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\nWhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\nhave done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\nas it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.\\nWe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\nhis friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\nShe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated\\nLady Russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\nthan to half a reformation.  Her knowledge of her father\\nand Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\nthrough the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\n\\nHow Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence.  Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all:\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort\\nof life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--\\ncontractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner\\nquit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s retrenching,\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him\\nthat Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\nIn any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house\\nin the country.  All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\nA small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\nLady Russell\\'s society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object\\nof her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\nShe disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\nand Bath was to be her home.\\n\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath\\nover London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\nof Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes.\\nIt would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne\\'s\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\n\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\nby passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,\\ntoo little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society\\nwould improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.\\n\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\nwhich stronger heads than Sir Walter\\'s have found too much.\\nKellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\n\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\nthe additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\nat Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\nthat Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\n\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\nthan because Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\nagainst previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\nbut always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\\nthis selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\n\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd\\none morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be\\nall wanting a home.  Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\nMany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  If a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\\n\\n\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter;\\n\"that\\'s all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\never so many before; hey, Shepherd?\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  Therefore, Sir Walter,\\nwhat I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,\\nmight conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\nI venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\nin the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\n\\nSir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\nnothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay\\'s health as a drive to Kellynch:\\n\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\nThe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now.  You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\n\\n\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\\nto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\nThe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\nis another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,\\nI assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"In all these cases, there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\nYour interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\nI venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.\"\\n\\nHere Anne spoke--\\n\\n\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\"\\nwas Mr Shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.\\nA man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\nany other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company\\nwith two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;\\nLord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\nwithout bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,\\nand a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `In the name of heaven,\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\n(Sir Basil Morley).  `Old fellow!\\' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin.\\nWhat do you take his age to be?\\'  `Sixty,\\' said I, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\n`Forty,\\' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.\\'  Picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.\\nI never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\nbut to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin\\'s age.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\nHave a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\\nThe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\nI have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\nSoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\neffect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\nI know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\nSir Walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,\\nhe had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.\\nBy the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,\\nAdmiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\nand had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\nMr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,\\nand understanding his (Mr Shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\nand mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,\\nI believe, several years.\"\\n\\n\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\nif Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the Admiral\\'s family, which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  A house was\\nnever taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\nA lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over.\\n\\n\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\\nand taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\\nwith business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\\nshe told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at Monkford.  Bless me! what was his name?\\nAt this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.\\nPenelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at Monkford:  Mrs Croft\\'s brother?\"\\n\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember\\nno gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"\\n\\n\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\\nI remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\\ncaught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nAfter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.\\nHe had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,\\nfor two or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.\\nYou remember him, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.\\nYou misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.\\nOne wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\\nno service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\nthey had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of Sir Walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nIt succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\nhe was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\nand authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained\\nat Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nSir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\nin all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\nSo far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing, in the Admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\"\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;\\na Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\na note of explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence,\\nand, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\\nIn all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence.\\n\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\\nwith a gentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps,\\nmay be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,\\nhis brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,\\nin the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\\nfor half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\nand Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\nand feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\nThey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\ndeeply in love.  It would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\nhaving them accepted.\\n\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\nTroubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\nHe thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nAnne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few,\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\nyouth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\nBut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\nHe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\nSuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;\\nbut Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\nShe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nSuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\nAnne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\nbut Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\nof success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had left the country\\nin consequence.\\n\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended Anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\nHer attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\n\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\nin change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  No one had ever\\ncome within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\nFrederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  No second attachment,\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\naround them.  She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had\\nlamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\nonly to Sir Walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\nand however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,\\nwhile Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\nBut in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\nand though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for Anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nThey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of Anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame\\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\nShe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,\\nall his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\nHe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\nHe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\nShe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\nshe could not hear that Captain Wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\nto live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\nShe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\\nand their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority\\nof Lady Russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft\\'s really\\ntaking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\n\\nThe sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards.\\n\\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s seeing Kellynch Hall,\\nAnne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell\\'s,\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\n\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\nand decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\non the Admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by Mr Shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\nto the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\n\\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\nand Mr Shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\n\"This indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\nand the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.\\nThe Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be\\nno harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\nesteemed about equal.\\n\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nLady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\\nof Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others.\\n\\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\nMary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\nUppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\ninstead of going to Bath.\\n\\n\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning;\\nand Elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay,\\nfor nobody will want her in Bath.\"\\n\\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nThis invitation of Mary\\'s removed all Lady Russell\\'s difficulties,\\nand it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\\ntill Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\\n\\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, Mrs Clay\\'s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,\\nin Mrs Clay\\'s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\n\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.\\nWith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope\\nof success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\n\\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\nand as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\nI can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,\\nI really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were\\na very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor\\nMrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\nthough I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her\\'s\\nand those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\nbut he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice\\nMrs Clay\\'s freckles.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne,\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\nalter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\n\\nAnne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\n\\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\\nMiss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.  The party drove off in very good spirits;\\nSir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\\nand Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\\nto the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\nand be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,\\nand Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage\\nof Lady Russell\\'s journey.\\n\\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old English style, containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\nfor his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,\\nFrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nHere Anne had often been staying.  She knew the ways of Uppercross\\nas well as those of Kellynch.  The two families were so continually meeting,\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house\\nat all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;\\nbut being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course.  Though better endowed than the elder sister,\\nMary had not Anne\\'s understanding nor temper.  While well, and happy,\\nand properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely.  She had no resources\\nfor solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  In person, she was\\ninferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\\nthe dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  She was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\\nand two children; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.\\nI am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning!\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\\nat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\\nas I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\nand not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.\\nI do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nAnne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\n\"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\nHe would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\nI assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind\\na word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.\\n\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours\\nat the Great House?\"\\n\\n\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,\\nexcept Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,\\nnot one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit\\nthe Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves\\nout of their way.\"\\n\\n\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\nIt is early.\"\\n\\n\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\nYou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:\\nand besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,\\nhave had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\\nleft Kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect\\nin a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\nI have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth\\'s plants\\nare for Lady Russell.  I have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\nand one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\nI was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up\\na great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  It would have been strange\\nif I had not gone.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were\\nso crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\nand Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into\\nthe back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non Anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on Mary\\'s.  She could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it,\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the Great House before they have\\nbeen to see you?\"\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.\\n\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\\nso well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\nThey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\nneither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old\\nEnglish style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\nTheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\nAnne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nThey were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the Great House family, which was generally,\\nas Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe Miss Musgroves, at Mary\\'s particular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\nShe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\nor without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\nwhich at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:\\n\"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\n\"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\nQueen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--\\n\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at Bath!\"\\n\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.\\n\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\nWith the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\nand all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.\\n\\nShe had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\nAnne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\nHe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to Anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\nfor a happy couple.  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\nfor while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them\\nvery well, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\nAnne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\nbut when listening in turn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils\\nthe children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\"\\n\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\nKnown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\n\"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\nwas Charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:\\n\"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,\\nyou might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse\\nthan I ever own.\"\\n\\nMary\\'s declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House,\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.\\nThey are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,\\nin general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\nbut Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\nBless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\nI otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\"  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\nI meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\nAnd on Mrs Musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for I know it would not do;\\nbut I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things\\nto rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\nI hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\nmy own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\nMrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\n\\nAgain, it was Mary\\'s complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\nat the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\nAnd one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\n\"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\nIt is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\nbut I know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\n\\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\nHer own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\nby being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary\\'s ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\nwas rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\nas she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\nExcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\nIn music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\nand Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\nfor her own.\\n\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\\nThe neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\nThere were more completely popular.\\n\\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\nwho depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\\n\"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nSo passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne\\'s heart\\nmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this\\nthe day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not\\nthink of it before.  How low it makes me!\"\\n\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\nto be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\n\"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked Charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\nAnne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\nShe wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned.  They came:  the master of the house\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\nthat Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nMrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\nShe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nHer manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\nAnne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\nof any sort.  She was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\nMrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\\n\\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\nwhen Mrs Croft\\'s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\nthat Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,\\nand not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\npresent state with proper interest.\\n\\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\nshe heard the Admiral say to Mary--\\n\\n\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say\\nyou know him by name.\"\\n\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\nShe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\nwhen the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\nwas the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\nwhen Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\nI am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\nof poor Richard!  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\nthat her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\nthat Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\npoor Richard\\'s captain at one time; I do not know when or where,\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\nand of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\n\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\nby calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\nunfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\nCaptain Frederick Wentworth\\'s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\n\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\nof the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\\nMr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\n\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\nfrom Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne\\'s nerves.\\nShe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\nSince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\n\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,\\nand Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\nand he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,\\nby the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment\\nto Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,\\nin Anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove\\'s civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\nShe and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child\\'s situation\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\n\\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\nIt was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nHer brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\nTill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\nthe information of Captain Wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\nmore full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\\n\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\nand Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\nto give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\nBut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\\nCharles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\nIt must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\nand Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\nThis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father\\nvery much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\n\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me\\nquite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.\\nYou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nMary knew, from Charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\nShe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\nbut as soon as there was only Anne to hear--\\n\\n\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\nI knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\nand Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\nTalks of his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\nI did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,\\nI am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all\\nequal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\\nof the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson\\'s directions,\\nand have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.\\nNursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\nA sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know\\nthat I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,\\nfor I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\nand you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think\\nCharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\nI am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.\\nI was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\\nto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,\\nI may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?\\nand it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\nare a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;\\nI am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,\\nindeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.\\nYou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\nis the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\nI should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child.\"\\n\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation, which began with Mary\\'s saying,\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\n\\n\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home\\nthan you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\nI should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\nAnne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\nIt is Anne\\'s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be\\na great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and I should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\nif Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\nagreeable to others?\\n\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\nPerhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\nHe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\n\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\nin Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\nin Mrs Charles Musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles\\'s being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\n\\nAnne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\n\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\nCharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;\\nhis sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\nand though Charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\n\\nMary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.\\nIn two minutes after Charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth\\'s,\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\nthe Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\nand Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\n\\n\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\\n\\nMary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.\\nThey had met.  They had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\nEight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\nHow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\\neight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part\\nof her own life.\\n\\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like\\nwishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\n\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\nfor, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was\\nso attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\nwhen they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\n\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\n\\n\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent,\\ndeep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\nlet him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\nShe had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.\\n\\n\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\nmake her happier.\\n\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\nHe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\nhad spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.\\nShe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\nconfident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.\\nIt had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been\\nweakness and timidity.\\n\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him\\nwas gone for ever.\\n\\nIt was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on shore,\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\nexcepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\nAnybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\nA little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\nand I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\n\\n\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior\\nI shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\\nI shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together\\nat Mr Musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\"\\n\"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\nAnne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\nThere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!\\nNow nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,\\nperhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\nNow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\nnever become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\nwhich reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\nof Mrs Musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,\\nI dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nAnne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\nshe found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.\\nI was the last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.\\nReported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off\\nto the West Indies.\"\\n\\nThe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nBut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,\\nyou would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\n\\n\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\nIt was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\na very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\nto be afloat again.\"\\n\\n\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\nAh! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.\\nI knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\nor that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate\\nI wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\nWe had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\npoor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation\\nnot having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,\\nand I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne\\'s shudderings\\nwere to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\n\\n\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there\\nhe met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\n\"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\nI always forgot.\"\\n\\n\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\nCharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\n\\n\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I\\nmade money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!\\nYou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.\\nExcellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,\\nso much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,\\nwhen I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget\\nwhat you did.\"\\n\\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\nof poor Richard.\"\\n\\n\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\nAh! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\nI assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\nwhich convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\n\\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.\\nIt was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\nand while the agitations of Anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\nA large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\\nwhich taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\n\\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\nnow came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\\nand her daughters.\"\\n\\n\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\nThere can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nThis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you. --All idle refinement!\\n--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.\\nI believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare\\nI have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\"\\n(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of\\nthe ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,\\nand three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that I could, and I would bring anything\\nof Harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine\\nthat I did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\\nand all her family to Plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\nWe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\nhe will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,\\nand a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married\\npeople begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,\\nwhen you are married.\\'  I can only say, `No, I shall not;\\' and then\\nthey say again, `Yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nHe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\\nto Mrs Croft.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\nthough many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic\\nfour times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\nCork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.  But I never went beyond the Streights,\\nand never was in the West Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,\\nyou know, the West Indies.\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\n\\n\"And I do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\nWhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\nand I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing\\nto be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered\\nin body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,\\nwhen the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.\\nI lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\nor when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\nnothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\\nMrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,\\nfor Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nThe evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,\\nAnne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\nof all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\nIf he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\nwho could wonder?\\n\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?\\nThe answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\nShe had rather play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too,\\nhe spoke to her.  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\nHis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe Admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  He had intended,\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\nof Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of Edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth\\namong the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth\\nvery much in the way.\\n\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth\\'s\\nintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\nonly two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money,\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,\\nbut it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove\\'s; and while\\nthe Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\nthe young Hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\nwith Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins.  Charles\\'s attentions to Henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;\\nbut from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne\\'s observation reached.\\nHenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\n\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different\\nat the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the Miss Musgroves\\' company, and Charles Hayter\\nhad but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\nCharles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\n\\nCharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\nhe had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\nHere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\nOh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should\\nrise to any very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!\\n`Lady Wentworth\\' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing,\\nindeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta\\nwould not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!\\nIt would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much\\nof your new creations.\"\\n\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;\\nand considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?\\nNothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove\\nof Uppercross.\"\\n\\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\n\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has\\na very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from\\nthe Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\npretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,\\nthat any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;\\nHenrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,\\nand Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\\nmarry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt\\nthat he has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.\\nI wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense\\nto say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.\\nBut Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you\\nwould have thought as I did, unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me.\"\\n\\nA dinner at Mr Musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\nof indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding\\nCaptain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nAs to Captain Wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\nthan that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.\\nEither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\ngood-humoured wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\\n\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\nwhen such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\nand obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.\\nThe advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\nof his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley\\'s\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,\\nbut had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:\\nshe was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\n\\n\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\\nI always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short,\\nyou know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nIs he coming, Louisa?\"\\n\\nOne morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,\\nat which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into\\nthe drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\nand could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:\\nMrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\nI dare say,\" had been Anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\nCaptain Wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nHe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\n\"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\\nthan Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.\\n\\nShe only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?\\nThe others will be here presently.\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\nthe newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nAnother minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nThere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\nbusy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.\\nShe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\nOnce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\n\\n\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome.\\nI am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\nDo not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to\\ncousin Charles.\"\\n\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir.\\n\\nIn another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\nbefore she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.\\n\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\nShe could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary\\nand the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\nand leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\\nthey were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\nIt was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his having said,\\nin a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth\\'s interference,\\n\"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\nand could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  But neither Charles Hayter\\'s feelings,\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\narranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\nfor while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.\\nThey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\nIt was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\nend in love with some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\nand yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\nAnne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\nShe did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\nany claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nAfter a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.\\nThree days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;\\na most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\nand having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nIt was Mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter\\nwas wise.\\n\\nOne morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the Mansion-house.\\n\\nIt was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\nMary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes,\\nI should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\"\\nAnne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\nthe Miss Musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\"\\nsaid Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing\\nthat I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\nif we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\nJust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\nTheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\n\\nAnne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\nShe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nIt was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\nmight fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.\\nLouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\nThis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\nof Louisa\\'s which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --\\n\\n\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.\\nI wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen\\nvery often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\\nas she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever\\nseparate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\nby anybody else.\"\\n\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\"\\nAnd there was silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\nblessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\ninto another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\"\\nBut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nWinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\nwhich parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nWinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nMary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\\nWell now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nHenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\nto do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\"\\ncried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly.\\n\\nCharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\nBut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\n\"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\n\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he\\nand Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\nto Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\nand saying to Captain Wentworth--\\n\\n\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,\\nI have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nShe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nThe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\nLouisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\nMary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\nwas sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  Anne found a nice seat\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\nMary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nAnne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\nCaptain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa\\'s voice was\\nthe first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech.  What Anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?\\nNo, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\\nmade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\nthe last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\nI see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,\\nyou have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\nYou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\nmay sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is a nut,\"\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not\\na weak spot anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\\n\"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\nIf Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nHe had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.\\nFor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\nWhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\nand they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, Louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\nand pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much\\nof the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.\\nI suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"When did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\\naccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nLady Russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  They think Charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,\\nand that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nThe sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\\nHer own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,\\nbefore she could move.  The listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character\\nwas considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation.\\n\\nAs soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\n\\nCharles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\nCharles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne\\ncould not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\nHenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\\nCharles Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\\n\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\nand least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles\\nand Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles\\'s other arm;\\nbut Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\nwith his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\nin being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\n\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft\\'s gig.\\nHe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\\nThe invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\n\"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room\\nfor three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might\\nsit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nAnne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral\\'s kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nYes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\nto give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\nThis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\nShe understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not\\nbe unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\nShe then found them talking of \"Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\\nsaid the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nAy, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have\\nsettled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;\\n\"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\nI had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always\\nbe company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;\\nI hardly know one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft,\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  One could not be\\nconnected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\n\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\nand Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\nand Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\nThis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\nat Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\nin leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.\\n\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\nCaptain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and\\nCaptain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.  They did not like each other,\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\nand she too little.\\n\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nThe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen\\nand unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\nA letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last,\\nhad brought intelligence of Captain Harville\\'s being settled\\nwith his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before, and Captain Wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\nand his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\n\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;\\nthough November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\nLouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,\\nLouisa, and Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\nbut to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\nthe middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\nfor going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  This was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove\\'s coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and Charles\\'s curricle, in which\\nhe drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nAfter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,\\nto make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,\\nCharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,\\nPinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\nIsle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\nto make the worth of Lyme understood.\\n\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.\\nCaptain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\nand he was to join them on the Cobb.\\n\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\nall well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,\\nand a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,\\non his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\nHe had been engaged to Captain Harville\\'s sister, and was now\\nmourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\npromotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.\\nShe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\nand sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,\\nthe friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\nand Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\nof Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick\\'s\\nstate of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick\\nwas very great.\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\nthan I have.  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\nHe is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\nyounger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nThey all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\na little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\nMrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\nbecause the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\nThe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\nof formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\n\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\nOn quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,\\nwere more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\nCaptain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\nCaptain Benwick.  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved.\\n\\nThey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\"\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\n\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in Captain Wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general.\\n\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne\\'s lot to be placed\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\nHe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\nand Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\nHe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion\\nor The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour\\nand The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\n\\nHis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\n\\nWhen the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\nThey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\nbreeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\nthe sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,\\nlast spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\nNow, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely,\\nand fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?  Do not you agree with me,\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?\\nShe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\nmake it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\nin case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.\\nI really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation,\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\nMy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\nI must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\nDo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  And at Lyme too,\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\nShe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\nfelt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\n\"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate\\nwith Dr Shirley.  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  I always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\nbut I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat Uppercross.\"\\n\\nAnne was amused by Henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof Henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\non seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.\\nThey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\nbut Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\nThey were all at her disposal.\\n\\nWhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\nand stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;\\nand as they passed, Anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nShe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\nCaptain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you,\\nand even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\\n\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\nShe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\nBoth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\nIt was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\n\\nThey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party\\nto the window.  It was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\nsomebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne\\'s curiosity,\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\nfrom Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\nat dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath\\nand London.\"\\n\\n\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,\\nit must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see,\\njust as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!\\nIn the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the Kellynch family?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!\\nHeir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,\\nif it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive\\nhow extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\nWhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\nDo you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,\\nI was looking at the horses; but I think he had something\\nof the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!\\nOh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\nso it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\nsaid Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nWhen she could command Mary\\'s attention, Anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\nShe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\nthe second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\nquite ill-used by Anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,\\nthe next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nAnne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given\\nher father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\nshe suspected; and that Mr Elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\\nfell on Anne.\\n\\nBreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain\\nand Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off\\nfor Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\nsome time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\nCaptain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible;\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\nand you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\\n\\n\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\\njust made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\nhe sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.\\nThere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.\\nI would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia\\nhad come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest;\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\ntravelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off\\nto the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\nThat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\\nYou may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nMrs Harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\nBy all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\nnear the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\nall were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the Cobb.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron\\'s\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\nhe did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\nHe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined\\nI will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\nshe fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\nThere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around!\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\n\"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\nand in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain\\nBenwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\n\\n\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\nburst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\nall his own strength were gone.\\n\\n\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\nI can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\nand Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\nand everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;\\nwhile Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\\n\\nHe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\nwhen Anne eagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?\\nHe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nAs to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\nCaptain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate\\nbrother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give.\\n\\nAnne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\nwhich instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,\\nto assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?\\nWhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\\nMusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people\\nHenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,\\nand Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\n\\nThey were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.\\nCaptain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\nShocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\nThey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\nbeneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville\\'s direction,\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them.\\n\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\nMary, too, was growing calmer.\\n\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\nThey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\nThe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,\\nmay be conceived.\\n\\nThe tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered\\nby Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them.\\n\\nLouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\nas to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,\\ndid not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The Harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\nThey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\nThey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville\\'s care entirely.\\nMrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\nwas just such another.  Between these two, she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\n\\nCharles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\n\"Uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to Uppercross;\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\nAt first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\nEvery minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off\\nfor Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\\n\\nCharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\nHe would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\nSo far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.\\nShe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness\\nof her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa\\'s room,\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\nShe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\n\\nThe plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly\\ndown from Louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\n\\n\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,\\n\"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.\\nBut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,\\nI think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,\\nwish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,\\nso capable as Anne.\"\\n\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\nand she then appeared.\\n\\n\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply,\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor\\nin Louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville\\nwould but think so.\"\\n\\nOne thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable\\nthat Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\nand Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\nand leave Mr Musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of Louisa\\'s night.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was\\nmade known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\nShe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was\\nnothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\nto stay in Henrietta\\'s stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?\\nAnd to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!\\nNo, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne\\nwas inevitable.\\n\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\nfor the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick\\nattending to her.  She gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta\\'s schemes\\nfor Dr Shirley\\'s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had\\nfirst seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,\\nmade but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.\\n\\nShe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating\\nthe feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have\\nattended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nIn the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.\\nHow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\nIt was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only,\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\nwalk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!\\nBut so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\\n\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\nand limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character.\\n\\nThey got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\nAnne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn a low, cautious voice, he said: --\\n\\n\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not\\nappear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in\\nand break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nShe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\n\\n(End of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of Anne\\'s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\nwas spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\nin Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\nbeen difficulties.\\n\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was\\nmuch the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\nCharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\nmore particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\nespecially of Mrs Harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"She really left\\nnothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night.  Mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\nWhen he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\nthat Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\nIt would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,\\nand Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of\\ngetting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;\\nbut without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\nand found practicable so soon.\\n\\nThey were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all\\nthe minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,\\nand his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in Lyme.\\n\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters\\nfor one another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.\\nShe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.\\nThey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\nthey might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\n\\nShe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross\\nits cheerful character.  A few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nIf Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than\\nformer happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt,\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\nA few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\nall that was most unlike Anne Elliot!\\n\\nAn hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\non a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\nto make the sound of Lady Russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House,\\nor look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\nScenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.\\nIt stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\nShe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been.\\n\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell\\'s house\\nin September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress.\\n\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,\\neither Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell\\nfancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\n\\nWhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\nThe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\namong the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;\\nand when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still\\nbe with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,\\nthan her own father\\'s house in Camden Place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\nwith Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.\\nLady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\nlament the result, and Captain Wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\nAnne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.\\nShe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\nLady Russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.\\nWhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\n\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\nbe charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.\\n\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,\\nwhich found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\na rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,\\nLady Russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\n\"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.\\nAnne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\nIt will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nAnne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\nin observing--\\n\\n\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\nBy remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nShe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  These convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\nthat pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,\\n\"These rooms ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen\\nin their destination!  How unworthily occupied!  An ancient family\\nto be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\"\\nNo, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave.\\n\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\nthat Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time\\nsince the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot\\'s not being\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\nThis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done.\\n\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\nhow long Miss Musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\nThe Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\nis not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\ntruly!\"\\n\\nAdmiral Croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,\\nbut they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\\nrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.\\nBut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself),\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\nin the butler\\'s room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.\\nOne man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\nAnd so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\n\\nAnne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral,\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,\\nat Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.\\nThe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter\\nwhat we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.\\nI have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\nA very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:\\nbut I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\n\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\nSuch a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away\\nfrom one\\'s self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\nshifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\nthat I never go near.\"\\n\\nAnne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,\\npray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft\\'s, and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\nI grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,\\nwith my compliments.  He will be glad to hear it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.\\n\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe enough,\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s going than Anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\nand as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross\\nthey drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nThey had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had\\ngot Mrs Harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\nsupply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable.\\n\\nMary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\nCharles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\nthey dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\nand at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\nCharles laughed.\\n\\n\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is\\na very odd young man.  I do not know what he would be at.\\nWe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\nI thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had\\n`been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.\\nI suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\nI should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage\\nfor such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\nCharles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well\\nhow it really was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.)\\n\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered\\nthat Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\nand he had not courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour,\\nMary knows it is.\"\\n\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\nnot considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\nAnne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be\\nleft to be guessed.  Anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard.  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\nand continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\"\\nMary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him\\nmention Anne twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne,\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\nHis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,\\nbut it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta\\nall about it; and then `Miss Elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\nNow Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were\\nin the other room.  `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' Oh! there was no end\\nof Miss Elliot\\'s charms.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\nif he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart\\nis very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling.\\n\\n\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\nhe will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,\\nyou may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,\\nand I told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\nand I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\nSo, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\\n\\n\"Any acquaintance of Anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\nwas Lady Russell\\'s kind answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! as to being Anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy\\nto see Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma\\'am.\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\nHe is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him.\"\\n\\n\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like him.\\nI think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\\nHe is just Lady Russell\\'s sort.  Give him a book, and he will\\nread all day long.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think\\nLady Russell would like that?\"\\n\\nLady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she,\\n\"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\nas I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\nI wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.\\n\\n\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.\\nHis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nThis decision checked Mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the Elliot countenance.\\n\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going\\ndown to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\\nto go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.\\nLady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\nCaptain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it\\nthan Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\na week\\'s indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\n\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\nbringing with them Mrs Harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\nof Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\n\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,\\nwhen Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nThough neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,\\nnor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\nof the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,\\nduring their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nAnne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\nwhich Louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,\\nwho got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home.\\n\\nLouisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\\n\\n\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross\\nin the Christmas holidays.\"\\n\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\nrather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,\\nwas entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\nunder their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\n\\nAnne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\nof Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\nMr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful\\nif it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\nno wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\nbut she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.\\n\\nShe was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\nand both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I\\nleave you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\nand met her with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\n\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination\\nto listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\nall their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:\\nit was all Bath.\\n\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\nor the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after.  Everybody was wanting to visit them.\\nThey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nHere were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\nwho had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\nThey had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.\\nHe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\nHe had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath\\nin November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of\\nSir Walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\nin Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\nwas completely re-established.\\n\\nThey had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted\\nof being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\nHe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\n\\nThe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\nSir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough\\nBuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it.\\n\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\nShe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\nThere had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,\\nnot all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\nHere was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in Camden Place.\\n\\nAnne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nShe heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\nin Mr Elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\nto be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\nIn all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\nand the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\nA sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;\\nit was, perhaps, for Elizabeth\\'s sake.  There might really have been\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,\\nand when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth\\nwere his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\nand that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot\\'s frequent visits\\nwere talked of.\\n\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\\nThey did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\\nto her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;\\nSir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think\\nthat he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean\\nto complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of\\nthe whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\nand there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\nin Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\nSir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.\\nHe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  The worst of Bath was\\nthe number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\nHe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\nas he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\na tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!\\nthey were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\nHe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\nupon Colonel Wallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed\\nto escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\\nthat Colonel Wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\nas Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.\\n\"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not\\nhappen every day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\nand grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!\\nIt was ten o\\'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine\\nin Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.\\nMrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot\\'s knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.\\nWith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\nMr Elliot was ushered into the room.\\n\\nIt was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nAnne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\nmust follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\n\"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\n(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking\\nas he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  They were not the same,\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\n\\nHe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,\\nhe began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\nShe gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.\\nHis regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\nIf he had but asked who the party were!  The name of Musgrove would\\nhave told him enough.  \"Well, it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\nare more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world.  The folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.\\n\\nHis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\nHaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\nWhen he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\nShe could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\n\\nHe staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-\\npiece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\nbefore Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\nCamden Place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot\\'s\\nbeing in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\nin love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay\\nto have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\n\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.\\nShe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say, \"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet,\\nyou have seen nothing of Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.\\nYou must not run away from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted\\nwith Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,\\nI well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised\\nto see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.\\nHer countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\nand promise to stay.\\n\\nIn the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\"\\nhe supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\nyou cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,\\nthe constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\nYou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must\\ntake its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\nif Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always\\ncommand a home with Lady Russell.\\n\\nLady Russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay\\nin such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\nas she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\"\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\nHe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\nHe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\nShe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis\\nsaid it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\\n\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\nIn Lady Russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\nand at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;\\ntime will explain.\"\\n\\nIt was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,\\nfelt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.\\nIn that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\nA little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,\\nAnne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nHowever it might end, he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\nas herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\n\\nThey did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance,\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\nand her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort\\nof No.--, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples\\n(in Anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\n\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\nall day long.\\n\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter\\'s\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.\\nNo letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\nHow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\nin a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\nthought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth preserving,\\ngood company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,\\nfor three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.\\nShe had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\nto his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.\\n\"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\nThe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  They visited\\nin Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\nand the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible:  and \"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin,\\nLady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nAnne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\\nbut for her birth.\\n\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\nthey had their value.  Anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\nthat is what I call good company.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\nthat is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\nBirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\nit will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.\\nShe is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin\"\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\\nWill it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,\\nthat they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride\\nthan any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\nIn London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\nit might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\nBut here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.\\nYou talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\nwould have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\na little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\n\"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nHe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\nand though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description.\\n\\nShe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\nof there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\\nnow Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nMiss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\nthat Anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nShe was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\n\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore\\nlost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\nor what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.\\nShe only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith\\'s lodgings\\nin Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nThe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\n\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\nand Anne\\'s astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith\\'s.  She had been\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\nHer accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\nYet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\nIt was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\n\\nThere had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,\\ncompared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\nShe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\n\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\nShe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\nShe always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody\\'s heart is open,\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,\\nsensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\n`the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\nCall it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour\\'s\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\nknow one\\'s species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\nTo me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nAnne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\n\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\nSuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\nAnd it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\nthough I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\nHere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\nThere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\nIt was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\n\\n\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.\\nShe has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all\\nthe high-priced things I have in hand now.\"\\n\\nAnne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\nof such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning\\nfrom Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\nin Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.\\nThey were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth\\nwas disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot\\nto be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;\\nand who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?\\nThat she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary,\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when I have\\ncalled on Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.\\n\"Sir Henry Russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\\nA poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\na mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\\n\\nMrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it\\nto himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\\nin Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\nand no surname of dignity.\\n\\nAnne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\nShe had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;\\nand Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,\\nand Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\nHer kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.\\nHe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell\\nin a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\n\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\nShe would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  Anne heard her,\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\nand gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell,\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\nI think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\nA most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\nI think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nLady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,\\nthe future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother\\'s self\\nin countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\nMy dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life!\"\\n\\nAnne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\nof having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself;\\nof being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\nLady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\nwhat Anne did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch\\nand of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.\\nAnd it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against Mr Elliot.\\n\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\nclear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,\\nif not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\nShe saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\nHow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\n\\nMr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\nThere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.\\nHer early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\nWarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,\\nstood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see\\nwhat Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\nMrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\n\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of\\nthe following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,\\nwas growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.\\nShe wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.\\nIt was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew\\nthat Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be\\nrecovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s compliments.\\n\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.\\nThey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an introduction.\\nI should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.\\nI know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nAnne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\nthe poor Admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\nIt had been begun several days back.\\n\\n\\n            \"February 1st.\\n\\n\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.\\nYou must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had\\na very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.\\nThe holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,\\nexcept of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\nWhat dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\nI have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,\\nexcept Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\nBetween ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\\nas long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\nThe carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.\\nWe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\nMrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\nI am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted\\nwith him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\nto be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\\nwith Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\nLet me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children\\nto be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well,\\nfor a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\\nare going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.\\nCharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\nI do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\\n\\n  \"Mary M---.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\nvery much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa\\nbore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal\\nto add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,\\nand I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.\\nI shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.\\nI have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\nShe and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\nas well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\nNeither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,\\nand not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.\\nTrue, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.\\nMrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\nWe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;\\nand Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick\\nis expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\\nwill say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;\\nI never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,\\nof Captain Benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\nHow Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.\\nCertainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the Hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nMary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\nof the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter\\nwanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\\nas it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\n\"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\\n\\n\"They come on the Admiral\\'s account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft\\'s\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft\\nwill be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.\\nElizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\nWe had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.\\nThere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\nI am told, are sailors.  The Crofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\nin an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\nAnne was at liberty.\\n\\nIn her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,\\njoyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\nfeeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!\\nWhere could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.\\nIt had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta\\'s\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\nand Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\nand Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary\\nmight have allowed.  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.\\nHe must love somebody.\\n\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\nHe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of\\nLouisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\nof its being so.  The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate.\\n\\nThe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\nand if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\nto be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne\\'s heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.\\nShe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\nThey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\n\\nShe longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\nThe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove\\nwas mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,\\nperfectly to Sir Walter\\'s satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,\\nand considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\nThey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\nHe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.\\nLady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\nKnowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\nto see the Admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the Croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\nand return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.\\nThis is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,\\nstaring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping.\\nBut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\\nDid you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\nwhich they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\"\\n(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\nWell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere\\nfor you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you\\nas we go along.  There, take my arm; that\\'s right; I do not\\nfeel comfortable if I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\"\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;\\nI shall only say, `How d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.\\n`How d\\'ye do?\\'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nShe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her heels,\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the street,\\nyou will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby fellows,\\nboth of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nSophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:\\ngot away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story\\nanother time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.\\nLook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\nAh! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!\\nHow do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.\\nWe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\nand draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch,\\nay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.\\nWe do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.\\nThe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\n\\nWhen they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\nfor the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was\\nnot really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.\\nAs soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\nBut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\nI am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have\\nall been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been\\nhappening to.  Her Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\\n\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\\nif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,\\nthis Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.\\nHe was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right.  But even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on.  Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,\\nand then he went off to see Edward.  When we came back from Minehead\\nhe was gone down to Edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\nWe have seen nothing of him since November.  Even Sophy could\\nnot understand it.  But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;\\nfor this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being\\nto marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne,\\n\"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\\nHe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.\\nAn excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom Captain Benwick\\'s manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,\\nand I will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nAnne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\nnot at all to represent Captain Benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\nshe was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.\\nWe have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\nin a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.\\nI fancy they are all at Uppercross.\"\\n\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\n\"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain\\nWentworth\\'s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.\\nIt did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\nand Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\n\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\ntoo much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\"\\n\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,\\nand beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.\\nIt would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other\\nMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\nDo not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing\\nhis wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were\\nin Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in Lady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,\\nturned into Molland\\'s, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,\\nto request her assistance.  He soon joined them again, successful,\\nof course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nHer ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt\\nas to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also\\na mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne\\'s;\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\\nhad a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,\\nthat his cousin Anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\n\\nIt was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\nCaptain Wentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\nand absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\nit was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\nand Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street\\non a commission of Mrs Clay\\'s.\\n\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.\\nShe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.\\nShe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\nCaptain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\na little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\nhe looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\nShe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\nAll the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,\\nshe had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\na something between delight and misery.\\n\\nHe spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nAfter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\nTime had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness\\nof some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\\nof the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\nCaptain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nIt did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\n\\nLady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\nIt was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\\nMiss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\nand Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them.\\nThe carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer walking.\"\\n\\n\"But it rains.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday,\\nI have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\"\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,\\nif you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\n\\nShe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\nand adding, \"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.\\nCaptain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,\\nadmiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"Good morning to you!\"\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\n\\nAs soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth\\'s party\\nbegan talking of them.\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.\\nHe is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.\\nWhat a very good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\nto look at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess\\nI admire her more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! so do I.\"\\n\\n\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.\\nAnne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.\\nShe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,\\nand insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now\\nshe could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\n\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\nhe meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?\\n\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter\\nLady Russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\nin returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\nShe looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was\\nnot to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nLady Russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\\nof her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell\\'s mind,\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\nof one personal grace!\\n\\nAt last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she\\nspeak of him?\"\\n\\n\"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\nbut I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and\\nMrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\nand I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess\\nI can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\neither at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\nA day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\nfor the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\nIt was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.\\nOf course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,\\nand Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\\nLady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\nMrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nWho is your party?\"\\n\\nAnne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\n\"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\nto-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding\\nthat I may not have many more visits from you.\"\\n\\nAnne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door\\nopened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\nHe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\"\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\nTheir being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\\nThis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nAfter talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time.\"\\n\\nShe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\n\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\nWhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be\\na very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think,\\nends the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\nThe Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\nAll this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nHe stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne\\'s cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,\\nhe proceeded thus--\\n\\n\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\nbut Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;\\nand I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\nit would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\\nIt seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\nFanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\nEither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\nso far as to say--\\n\\n\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\\n\\n\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa\\'s doing well\\nwas quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.\\nShe would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.\\nThe country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;\\nand the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\\n\\n\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\nI should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne;\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\nOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\nby no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\nat Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nAs she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot\\nand Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was\\na group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.\\nShe was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\nShe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\ntowards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\nShe was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\nas being less happy than herself.\\n\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw\\nthat he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\na moment\\'s regret.  But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her,\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\n\\nUpon Lady Russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\nand proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\n\\nVery, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be\\nan insult to the nature of Anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\n\\nAnne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\nHer happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\na hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\nin only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\nat Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  Yes, some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less.  He must love her.\\n\\nThese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on,\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\nAnne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\nMiss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof Colonel Wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nAnne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\nat least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,\\nin the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained\\nthe words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\nfor certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend\\nto understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.\\nYou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;\\nand I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since\\nI came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family.\"\\n\\n\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\nNo one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\nis irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,\\nbut he would not tell.\\n\\n\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\nHe had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot\\'s company,\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\nVery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,\\nI would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nSuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\nHer father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air\\nthan one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;\\nCaptain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant\\nin Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\\n\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne\\'s eyes had caught\\nthe right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.\\nIt seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\n\\nWhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nMr Elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\\n\\nThe first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nHe did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again,\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\nTo Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\nShe could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nIn re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\nwas favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,\\nand Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\nand a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,\\nwithout comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed.\\n\\nSuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth\\nwas again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something\\nmust be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\\nwas strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,\\nof Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\nHe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain\\nWentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\nAnne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.\\nIt came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\nto explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\nA few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night;\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.\\nCaptain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it\\na week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nBut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\nHow was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?\\nHow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think\\nof Mr Elliot\\'s attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\nMr Elliot was almost a first object.\\n\\nShe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\nperhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.\\nHow she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\nher affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nPrettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\ncould never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne\\nwas sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.\\nIt was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\n\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne\\'s recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\\nwas well know by name to Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\nThey never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\\nin the room.\"\\n\\n\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\nwith the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,\\nI know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;\\nfor as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\nfor hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen\\nvery little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.\\nThere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\nand this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\n\\n\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nAnne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\nA blush overspread Anne\\'s cheeks.  She could say nothing.\\n\\n\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,\\n\"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time.\"\\n\\nAnne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\nhow any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.\\nAfter another short silence--\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\nDoes he know that I am in Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment\\'s reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\nmore composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.\\nHad I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.\\nI want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.\\nHe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\nof course it is done.\"\\n\\n\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\nI am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\nYou must consider me only as Mr Elliot\\'s relation.  If in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\nI beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.\\nI ought to have waited for official information,  But now, my dear\\nMiss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\\nNext week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\nMr Elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\nI assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.\\nI should like to know why you imagine I am?\"\\n\\nMrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew\\nwhat you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?\\nLet me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for\\nmy former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?\\nWhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\nLet me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly,\\n\"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\nDo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  Let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\nNinety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,\\nI hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,\\nand safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\nHe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.\\nI have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\nto do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\nI think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner\\nof speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\nSurely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\nShould he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you\\nI shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\\n\\nShe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed\\nno one in particular.\"\\n\\n\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in.  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday;\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.\\nShe had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\nShe sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\n\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make\\na very long history, I think, of one such little article\\nof unfounded news.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?\\nShall I take any message?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,\\nand under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,\\nI have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"I did.\"\\n\\n\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Intimately.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\nI have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.\\nWas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nThey were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers\\nI have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.\\nI have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.\\nThere were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\nEven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;\\nI think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith Mr Elliot\\'s real character.  Though I fully believe that,\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,\\nbe differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.\\nThose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\nHe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\nOh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nAnne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\nBut I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.\\nI will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.\\nHe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\nand thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,\\nbecame excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not\\nthink very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\nalways together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.\\nHe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\nhe had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\nMy poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse\\nwas open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot\\'s life,\"\\nsaid Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\nIt must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\nwhich I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\n\\n\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,\\nbut I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited\\nand encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\nI knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\nI was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\nI did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\nI have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.\\nHe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\nand I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\nI cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\nThat was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.\\nHe told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.\\nIt was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\nand that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\nspoke of me to Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nShe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\"\\ncried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.\\nI could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;\\nI have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\\nThe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\nto his character.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\\nWhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young,\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.\\nI think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what Mr Elliot was doing.  `To do the best for himself,\\'\\npassed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,\\nwas all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\nthrown by chance into Mr Elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\nwith respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\nDepend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\nHis chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\nbut I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\\non that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\nThis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\nI am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\n\\n\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;\\nstay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nAnne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\nThe box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\na small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.\\nThe letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\nBut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\nand when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\nHere it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad\\nthat I can produce it.\"\\n\\nThis was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\\nand dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --\\n\\n\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.\\nI wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\nAt present, believe me, I have no need of your services,\\nbeing in cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.\\nThey are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\nThe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\nhe is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse\\nthan last year.\\n\\n\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of Walter\\nI can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\nto be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\\n\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;\\nand Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\\nthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nBut it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\\nCan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\nyou were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"Can you really?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\nand I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,\\nbut I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.\\nHe truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:\\nhis friend Colonel Wallis.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\\nof his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\nbut Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\nShe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend\\nMrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.\\nWhen I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.\\nMr Elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\nThat was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when I arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\nNobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you\\nindeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without\\nknowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?\\nDid he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\'\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\n\\n\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.\\nI happened to be at Lyme.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\\nat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,\\nand from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive\\nin his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,\\nwhich I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\nwhom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\\nas long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter\\'s acquaintance,\\nof her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise\\nthat Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,\\nand she continued--\\n\\n\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\nvisit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,\\nthat time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot\\'s opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\nHe cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\nof coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\nMr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\nadded another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.\\nHe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\ncalled at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.\\nYou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\nI know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.\\nI have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\nI should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.\\nA scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\nbut my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `Why, to be sure,\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,\\nis a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter\\'s making a second match.\\nShe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through\\nMrs Wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.\\nMy line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\n\\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\nand Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\nMrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\nFrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\nThey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot\\'s regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\nurgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\nAnne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\nusual state of mind.\\n\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.\\nMr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\nShe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\nThis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\nwas hard to bear.\\n\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne\\'s good offices\\nwith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\nsince he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne\\'s feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliot\\'s character would allow,\\nwhen Anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at Mrs Smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him!\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\nI considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,\\nthan if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,\\nas I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\nHe was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.\\nBut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\nI was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\n\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\nwas, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.\\nThere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as\\nopposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\nPity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.\\nIn every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.\\nShe must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\n\\n\\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\nescaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\nso Mrs Clay says, at least.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  However, when I found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly.\\nMr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,\\nto turn her eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!\\nDear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  If you will have such\\nideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\nI did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.\\nWhen I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\\nthe sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise.\\n\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\nShe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\n\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable.\\n\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\\nhis return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.\\nIt was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\nIt was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay\\'s selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot\\'s\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\nShe saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.\\nOh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\nand pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\nYou need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.\\nI used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her\\nat the concert.  Something so formal and arrange in her air!\\nand she sits so upright!  My best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,\\nthat I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;\\nbut I shall only leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\nIf she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\nbut last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?\\nAnne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\nAfter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\nand \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\n\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\nbut Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\nThey were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were\\nat the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;\\nbut till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\nAnne could not draw upon Charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,\\nand Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by Captain Harville\\'s wanting to\\ncome to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed\\ncoming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had\\nsome old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\na good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.\\nMrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\\n\\nAnne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor Henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,\\nvery recently, (since Mary\\'s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\nquite as soon as Louisa\\'s.  \"And a very good living it was,\"\\nCharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.\\nIn the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get\\na special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\nhe observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That\\'s the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\nI hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should have\\ndaughters\\' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta\\'s match.\\nShe never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,\\nnor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;\\nand I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  They do everything\\nto confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\n\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\nand Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\nall day long.\"\\n\\nAnne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste,\\nI know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think\\nI am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.\\nWe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\nthat I have liked him the better ever since.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles\\'s\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs.\\n\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\nas they were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister,\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nElizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\nShe felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.\\nIt was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\nand then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:\\n\"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\nto give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\nand I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;\\nput her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  I will ask them all for an evening;\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\nThey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted\\nto come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,\\nbut most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\nMary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked\\nto meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;\\nand Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her\\nand Henrietta directly.\\n\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;\\nbut Anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\nand Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\nand on Charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\nhistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have\\nher moments of imagining.\\n\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with\\nCaptains Harville and Wentworth.  The appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  It was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\nTheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.\\nHe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\\n\"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  And yet,\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind.\\n\\n\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay,\\nI am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\nI saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed\\ndeep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.\\nIt is Mr Elliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.\\nHe was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nMary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne\\nto come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late\\nif you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.\\nHe is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have\\nforgot all about Lyme.\"\\n\\nTo pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\nAnne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,\\ncertainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,\\nor I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\n\\nThe visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.\\nI have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\nA\\'n\\'t I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nIt holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.\\nHave not I done well, mother?\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\nTake a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\nHow can you be so forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\nNever worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,\\nI think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,\\nbut I shall go to the play.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\n\\n\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n`happy.\\'  There was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.\\nWe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.\\nNothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\nWe are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention\\nis due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.\\n\"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,\\nI should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\nWhat is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,\\nwho saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.\\n\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back\\nand change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,\\nand we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on Mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\nI have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\n\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;\\nCharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\\n\\n\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.\\nI am no card-player.\"\\n\\n\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\n\"It is a period, indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne\\'s imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\nshould come in.\\n\\nThey were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\nwherewith to pity her.\\n\\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\nfor Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\nHow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nShe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nElizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\\nexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.\\n\"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\nIt was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,\\nthat Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\nThe past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,\\nand Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\nbut not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\nShe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"Only think of Elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered Mary\\nvery audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!\\nYou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nAnne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nThe party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\nAnne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose.\\n\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\nquestion, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\n\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in Mrs Clay\\'s face as she listened.  It was transient:\\ncleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature: --\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise\\nI met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.\\nHe turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\\nsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;\\nfor I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\nHe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\nHe was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that I have been\\nfull of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day only had passed since Anne\\'s conversation with Mrs Smith;\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be\\nwith the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,\\nand Mr Elliot\\'s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade\\'s head,\\nmust live another day.\\n\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart,\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\nThe party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,\\nand Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard\\nthat Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,\\nno waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after\\nher entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\n\\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\nAnne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\nas Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\n\"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,\\nand what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\nto my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\nI said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\nit was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"And so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\nfor Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\nAt any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\n\"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against\\nfor my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\nan engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\nI hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\nbut Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\nher mind was in confusion.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him,\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\n\"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself\\nand went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  As she joined him,\\nCaptain Harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)\\n\"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our\\nwalking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--\\nbut no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with\\na clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\nand I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\nIt was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?\\nI hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\nover to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\nCaptain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\n\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\nIt is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.\\nWe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\nYou are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply\\nto Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall\\nwe say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  I will not allow it to be more\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\nor have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\nMan is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nNay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\nYou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\nYou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nYour home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\"\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\nadded to all this.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\nIt was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught.\\n\\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\\n\\n\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.\\nI am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,\\nand want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,\\nI suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.\\nBut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\nprose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think\\nI ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all\\nwritten by men.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\nin books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\nbeen in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nWe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\n\"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\nand then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\nAnd then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\nand saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\nas if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\nIf I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\nI speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\nwith emotion.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,\\nand by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\nI should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\nso long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\nan object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\nAll the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.\\nAnd when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\nTheir attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.\\n\\n\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.\\n\"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\nTo-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\n(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\nand I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;\\nand you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I\\nshall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,\\nI am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.\\nI shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\n\\nMrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how\\nto understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\"\\nfrom Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\nHe had passed out of the room without a look!\\n\\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\nplaced it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\nalmost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\nthe work of an instant!\\n\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost\\nbeyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\nto \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,\\nhe had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\n\\n\\n\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,\\nhalf hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\nand a half ago.  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.\\nUnjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,\\nbut never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.\\nFor you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?\\nCan you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even\\nthese ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have\\npenetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\nToo good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.\\nYou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\nBelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\\n\\n\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,\\nwill be enough to decide whether I enter your father\\'s house\\nthis evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half and hour\\'s solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.\\nAnd before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\nCharles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\\n\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\nShe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\nstir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\nshe said she would go home.\\n\\n\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\nI wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.\\nCharles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\\n\\nBut the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\ncould not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\nin the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\nfinding her better at night.\\n\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"I am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\nPray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\\nand Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.\\nCaptain Harville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\\nWill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\nYou will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville\\nanywhere, remember to give Miss Anne\\'s message.  But indeed, my dear,\\nyou need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,\\nI\\'ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\"\\n\\nAnne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,\\nhowever.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby Captain Harville.  Another momentary vexation occurred.\\nCharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\nthere was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\n\\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\nof Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\nAnne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\nand not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.\\nPresently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,\\nor farther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\\nBecause, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\nShe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\nand I ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the Market Place.\\nHe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\nthat I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.\\nBy his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\nwhich you shot with one day round Winthrop.\"\\n\\nThere could not be an objection.  There could be only the most\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\nIn half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\nand estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nShe had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\n\\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.\\nHe never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\nto be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\na sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at\\nCaptain Harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\n\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\nfor Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which Louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\nThere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\n\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof Louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,\\nI could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\nperhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour\\nif she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously\\non this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had\\nno right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls,\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\nill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\nif her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.\\nIt determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\nHe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\nI could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith Benwick.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;\\nI could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first\\nfive minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,\\' and I was.\\nWas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope?  You were single.  It was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help\\noften saying, `Was this for me?\\'\"\\n\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,\\nbut the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward\\nin the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot\\'s appearing\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\nwith energy.\\n\\n\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on\\nwithout agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\\nwas it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\nWhen I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\nin aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\\nof your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\nI had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit\\nwas to be added.\"\\n\\n\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,\\nI was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,\\nand I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nAt last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\nAn interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment.\\n\\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\nIt was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found\\nan evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\nMr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\nShe cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\nand with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;\\nand I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,\\nthat I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place\\nof a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\nand for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right\\nin submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,\\nbecause I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now,\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\\nto reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\nI trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned\\nto England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\nand was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,\\nwould you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\nbut I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.\\nI shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\nThis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\nI have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\nwith a smile. \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\nI must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and\\nan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\nSir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\n\\nSir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,\\nwhen he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour.\\n\\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\nand do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what\\nLady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth\\'s manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\nMr Elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less\\nfor Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes.\\n\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\nin others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nOf all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\nit was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\nAnne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.\\n\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\nShe had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nThe news of his cousins Anne\\'s engagement burst on Mr Elliot\\nmost unexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\nhis best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  But, though discomfited\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay\\'s\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in London, it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nMrs Clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of Sir William.\\n\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\n\\nAnne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell\\'s meaning\\nto love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity.  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\nLady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself.  Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\nhe could now value from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\nand as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently.\\n\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\nsecured her two.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\nand Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husband\\'s property in the West Indies, by writing for her,\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\n\\nMrs Smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\nShe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\nand yet be happy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits, as her friend Anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\nAnne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s affection.  His profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n        Finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed. This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened: \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL. \"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\" Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth \"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife. Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto: \"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,\" and Sir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale: \"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the second Sir Walter.\" Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character; vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion. His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own. Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards. She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them. Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father. She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters. This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance. Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow. That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation. Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake. For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not been very much tempted to do. Elizabeth had succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily. His two other children were of very inferior value. Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way she was only Anne. To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite, and friend. Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again. A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work. All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably. It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost. It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing. Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot about Lady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him. Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment. Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was. For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country. Thirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world. She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two. Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not. Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away. She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of. The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her. She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should. He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction. He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed. He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came. The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married. Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth. Sir Walter has resented it. As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he observed, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons.\" His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded. Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it: all acquaintance between them had ceased. This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot\\'s eldest daughter. There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal. Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again. The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own. This could not be pardoned. Such were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy. But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these. Her father was growing distressed for money. She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts. The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required in its possessor. While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it. It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter. He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom. But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards. Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy. She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne. There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference. He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell. No; he would never disgrace his name so far. The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire, as he had received it. Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride. Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted. Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it much serious consideration. She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles. She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be. She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding. She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them. Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties. They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt. But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing: she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of honesty against importance. She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity. \"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell, looking over her paper, \"much may be done. If he will adopt these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle. What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have done, or ought to do? There will be nothing singular in his case; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as it always does of our conduct. I have great hope of prevailing. We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father, there is still more due to the character of an honest man.\" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him. She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it. She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty. She rated Lady Russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation. Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle reductions. How Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence. Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all: could not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort of life knocked off! Journeys, London, servants, horses, table contractions and restrictions every where! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman! No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\" \"Quit Kellynch Hall.\" The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode. \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side. It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support. In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household.\" Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out. There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in the country. All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter. A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell\\'s society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her ambition. But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on. She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home. Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred. It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament: he might there be important at comparatively little expense. Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight: its more convenient distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there. Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes. It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood. Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s feelings they must have been dreadful. And with regard to Anne\\'s dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising, first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly, from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself. Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health, by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits good. Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spirits were not high. A larger society would improve them. She wanted her to be more known. The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the beginning. He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir Walter\\'s have found too much. Kellynch Hall was to be let. This, however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own circle. Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house. Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word \"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again. Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour, that he would let it at all. How quick come the reasons for approving what we like! Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country. Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted. It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with the additional burden of two children. She was a clever young woman, who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of caution and reserve. Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because Elizabeth deserved it. She had never received from her more than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against previous inclination. She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain: Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility. From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore an object of first-rate importance. \"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, \"that the present juncture is much in our favour. This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore. They will be all wanting a home. Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants. Many a noble fortune has been made during the war. If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter \" \"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter; \"that\\'s all I have to remark. A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?\" Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added \"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business, gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with. I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with. Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the trouble of replying.\" Sir Walter only nodded. But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room, he observed sarcastically \"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\" \"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\" said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present: her father had driven her over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay\\'s health as a drive to Kellynch: \"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant. I have known a good deal of the profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful in all their ways! These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe. Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now. You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected.\" \"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it. I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant. The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds, is another thing. I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden. I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\" After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say \"In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant. Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands. Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights. I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.\" Here Anne spoke \"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give. Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow.\" \"Very true, very true. What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr Shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s; but Sir Walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards \"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.\" \"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise. \"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of objection to it. First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man. I have observed it all my life. A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line. One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. `In the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?\\' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley). `Old fellow!\\' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin. What do you take his age to be?\\' `Sixty,\\' said I, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\' `Forty,\\' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.\\' Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin. I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all: they are all knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen. It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin\\'s age.\" \"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed. Have a little mercy on the poor men. We are not all born to be handsome. The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth. But then, is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other? Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural effect of time. The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman \" she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman; \"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere. In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.\" It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent. By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing (it was just as he had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,) accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant. \"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry. Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family, and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed, added \"He is a rear admiral of the white. He was in the Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I believe, several years.\" \"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\" Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale, hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman. Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral\\'s family, which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant. He was a married man, and without children; the very state to be wished for. A house was never taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children. A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture in the world. He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over. \"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\" continued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms, and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford: Mrs Croft\\'s brother?\" But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not hear the appeal. \"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\" \"Bless me! how very odd! I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose. A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an amicable compromise. Very odd indeed!\" After waiting another moment \"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne. Mr Shepherd was all gratitude. \"Wentworth was the very name! Mr Wentworth was the very man. He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two or three years. Came there about the year -5, I take it. You remember him, I am sure.\" \"Wentworth? Oh! ay, Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford. You misled me by the term gentleman. I thought you were speaking of some man of property: Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family. One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\" As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant. It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen. Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer. So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in the Admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just high enough, and not too high. \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\" would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr ; a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of explanation. An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small. In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence. Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her. Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a gentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here.\" He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half a year at Monkford. He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling. Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail. They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love. It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted. A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one. Troubles soon arose. Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter. He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one. Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to think of! Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence! It must not be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love, and mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented. Captain Wentworth had no fortune. He had been lucky in his profession; but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing. But he was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted. He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still. Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently. His sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her. She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil. It only added a dangerous character to himself. He was brilliant, he was headstrong. Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror. She deprecated the connexion in every light. Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could combat. Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain. She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing: indiscreet, improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it. But it was not a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end to it. Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own, she could hardly have given him up. The belief of being prudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment. He had left the country in consequence. A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance; but not with a few months ended Anne\\'s share of suffering from it. Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect. More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty or enlargement of society. No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory. No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them. She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself. But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne\\'s being tempted, by some man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits. They knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change, on the one leading point of Anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen. She did not blame Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her; but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good. She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on. All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified. His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path. He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place. He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune. She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married. How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence! She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning. With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not hear that Captain Wentworth\\'s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea. She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil. She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it. She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft\\'s really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received any information of their short-lived engagement. That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s having heard of it from him. The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards. With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch, and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not involve any particular awkwardness. On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s seeing Kellynch Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell\\'s, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them. This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided the whole business at once. Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding. The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr Shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that \"This indenture sheweth.\" Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say, that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton. The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.\" reciprocal compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal. The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement. Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon, and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything considered, she wished to remain. It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others. Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty. Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath. \"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning; and Elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.\" To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay. This invitation of Mary\\'s removed all Lady Russell\\'s difficulties, and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge. So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her, which was, Mrs Clay\\'s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her. Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay\\'s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore aggravation. Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell. With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible. She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind. Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been. Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister. She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning. She spoke, and seemed only to offend. Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation. \"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people. And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now. If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy. But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety. One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times. That tooth of her\\'s and those freckles. Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him. I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them. You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay\\'s freckles.\" \"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne, \"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\" \"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly; \"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones. However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\" Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good. Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it. The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter, Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week. Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly. Their respectability was as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit. It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne. Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell\\'s journey. Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on. Here Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary had not Anne\\'s understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits; but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of being \"a fine girl.\" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with \"So, you are come at last! I began to think I should never see you. I am so ill I can hardly speak. I have not seen a creature the whole morning!\" \"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne. \"You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!\" \"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure. Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not able to ring the bell! So, Lady Russell would not get out. I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\" Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband. \"Oh! Charles is out shooting. I have not seen him since seven o\\'clock. He would go, though I told him how ill I was. He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one. I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\" \"You have had your little boys with you?\" \"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good. Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\" \"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully. \"You know I always cure you when I come. How are your neighbours at the Great House?\" \"I can give you no account of them. I have not seen one of them to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was, not one of them have been near me. It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out of their way.\" \"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone. It is early.\" \"I never want them, I assure you. They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me. Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday.\" \"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner.\" \"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\" \"A great many things, I assure you. More than I can recollect in a moment; but I can tell you some. I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures. I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth\\'s plants are for Lady Russell. I have had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave. I was told that they wished it. But all these things took up a great deal of time.\" \"Oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\" \"Did you go then? I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party.\" \"Oh yes! I went. I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning. It would have been strange if I had not gone.\" \"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\" \"Nothing remarkable. One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one\\'s own. Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded! They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward. So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it.\" A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on Mary\\'s. She could soon sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time. Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk. \"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready. \"I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you?\" \"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne. \"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\" \"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible. They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister. However, we may as well go and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can enjoy our walk.\" Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that, though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither family could now do without it. To the Great House accordingly they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour, with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction. Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment. The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration, perhaps of improvement. The father and mother were in the old English style, and the young people in the new. Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and not at all elegant. Their children had more modern minds and manners. There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry. Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad. Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters. They were received with great cordiality. Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well knew, the least to blame. The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary\\'s particular invitation. Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea. She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: \"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of, \"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of \"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!\" She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell. The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours, dress, dancing, and music. She acknowledged it to be very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into. With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible. She had no dread of these two months. Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort. She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion. Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation, or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits. As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else. He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple. They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked. As to the management of their children, his theory was much better than his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad. \"I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had the smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\" One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house. Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable. \"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\" was Charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: \"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was anything the matter with me. I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might persuade him that I really am very ill a great deal worse than I ever own.\" Mary\\'s declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day.\" And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children. They are quite different creatures with you! But to be sure, in general they are so spoilt! It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them. They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated ! Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes. I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should. I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\" She had this communication, moreover, from Mary. \"Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long. I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them. If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\" And on Mrs Musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles\\'s nursery-maid: I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near. Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of mentioning it.\" Again, it was Mary\\'s complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place. And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, \"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma. Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it. It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many persons.\" How was Anne to set all these matters to rights? She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister\\'s benefit. In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well. Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary\\'s ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage. It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters. She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware. She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation. Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste. In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\' performance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own. The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company. The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family. There were more completely popular. The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally, in an unpremeditated little ball. There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment; \"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed! Lord bless me! how those little fingers of yours fly about!\" So passed the first three weeks. Michaelmas came; and now Anne\\'s heart must be in Kellynch again. A beloved home made over to others; all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own other eyes and other limbs! She could not think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch? I am glad I did not think of it before. How low it makes me!\" The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be visited. Mary deplored the necessity for herself. \"Nobody knew how much she should suffer. She should put it off as long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back. Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going. She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned. They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression. Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person. She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty. Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour. Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft\\'s side, to give a bias of any sort. She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying, \"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\" Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not. \"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft. She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs Croft\\'s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s present state with proper interest. The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she heard the Admiral say to Mary \"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say you know him by name.\" He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question. She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling. The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in. That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage. \"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it. I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte. I will tell you why she is out of spirits. When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard\\'s captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow! And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard! So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things.\" The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before. He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead. He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth\\'s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money. In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur. She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death. Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them. To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne\\'s nerves. She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself. Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points. And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival. The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening. A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week. It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars. But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week. Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove\\'s civility, and she was all but calling there in the same half hour. She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall. The child\\'s situation put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account. His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas. It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants. Her brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary. Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give the information of Captain Wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all a favourite before. How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought. And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles. The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy, to give him the meeting. \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs. Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; \"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away. Only think if anything should happen?\" The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day. It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer confinement. The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do? This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up. His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house. \"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he; \"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right. Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all. You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use. Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.\" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain. Mary knew, from Charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him. She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only Anne to hear \"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening! I knew how it would be. This is always my luck. If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles is as bad as any of them. Very unfeeling! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy. Talks of his being going on so well! How does he know that he is going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling. So here he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child. My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried. I am not at all equal to it. You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\" \"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock. You will not be hysterical again. I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us. I perfectly understand Mr Robinson\\'s directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband. Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province. A sick child is always the mother\\'s property: her own feelings generally make it so.\" \"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin kicking about. I have not nerves for the sort of thing.\" \"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy?\" \"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I? Jemima is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was. I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come. I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is. I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\" \"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself, suppose you were to go, as well as your husband. Leave little Charles to my care. Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him.\" \"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening. \"Dear me! that\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed. To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home am I? and it only harasses me. You, who have not a mother\\'s feelings, are a great deal the properest person. You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you at a word. It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima. Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone. An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne. I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly. You can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you. I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child.\" The next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door, and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole conversation, which began with Mary\\'s saying, in a tone of great exultation \"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than you are. If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like. Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him. It is Anne\\'s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\" \"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\" Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening, when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits. They were gone, she hoped, to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers. She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself agreeable to others? She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting. Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances. He must be either indifferent or unwilling. Had he wished ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting. Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance, and their visit in general. There had been music, singing, talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles. He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore, somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles\\'s being to meet him to breakfast at his father\\'s. Anne understood it. He wished to avoid seeing her. He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet. The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though Charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice. Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the most consoling, that it would soon be over. And it was soon over. In two minutes after Charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared; they were in the drawing-room. Her eye half met Captain Wentworth\\'s, a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it. Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen: the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could. \"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude. \"The worst is over!\" Mary talked, but she could not attend. She had seen him. They had met. They had been once more in the same room. Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less. Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up. How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness! What might not eight years do? Events of every description, changes, alienations, removals all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past how natural, how certain too! It included nearly a third part of her own life. Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing. Now, how were his sentiments to be read? Was this like wishing to avoid her? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question. On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: \"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so attentive to me. Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not have known you again.\\'\" Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way, but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound. \"Altered beyond his knowledge.\" Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep mortification. Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse. She had already acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of her as he would. No: the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages. She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth. \"So altered that he should not have known her again!\" These were words which could not but dwell with her. Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them. They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier. Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but without an idea that they would be carried round to her. He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had spoken as he felt. He had not forgiven Anne Elliot. She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident temper could not endure. She had given him up to oblige others. It had been the effect of over-persuasion. It had been weakness and timidity. He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again. Her power with him was gone for ever. It was now his object to marry. He was rich, and being turned on shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow. He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne Elliot. This was his only secret exception, when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions: \"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match. Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking. A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man. Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?\" He said it, she knew, to be contradicted. His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with. \"A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description. \"That is the woman I want,\" said he. \"Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much. If I am a fool, I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than most men.\" From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle. They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings. Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth. His profession qualified him, his disposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\" \"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself. There must be the same immediate association of thought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain. They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the commonest civility required. Once so much to each other! Now nothing! There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another. With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved. Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted. It was a perpetual estrangement. When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind. There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use. From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying \"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\" Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore, could not keep pace with the conversation of the others. When she could let her attention take its natural course again, she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded. \"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\" \"You will not find her there. Quite worn out and broken up. I was the last man who commanded her. Hardly fit for service then. Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West Indies.\" The girls looked all amazement. \"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then, with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed. But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\" \"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day. For an old built sloop, you would not see her equal. Lucky fellow to get her! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time. Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more interest than his.\" \"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth, seriously. \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire. It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\" \"To be sure you did. What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together? If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again.\" \"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\" \"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling. \"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself. Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me. She did all that I wanted. I knew she would. I knew that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted. I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck. We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition. Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne\\'s shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror. \"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her), \"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother. I always forgot.\" \"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know. Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\" \"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend.\" Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case, only nodded in reply, and walked away. The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had. \"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia! How fast I made money in her. A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands. Poor Harville, sister! You know how much he wanted money: worse than myself. He had a wife. Excellent fellow. I shall never forget his happiness. He felt it all, so much for her sake. I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\" \"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us, when you were put captain into that ship. We shall never forget what you did.\" Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more. \"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking of poor Richard.\" \"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady, and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care! Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you. I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth\\'s face at this speech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove\\'s kind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings. They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier, indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for. Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain which taste cannot tolerate which ridicule will seize. The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with \"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters.\" \"Should I? I am glad I was not a week later then.\" The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry. He defended himself; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few hours might comprehend. \"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry towards them. It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have. There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do. I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\" This brought his sister upon him. \"Oh! Frederick! But I cannot believe it of you. All idle refinement! Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England. I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war. I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\" (with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\" \"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother. \"You were living with your husband, and were the only woman on board.\" \"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth. Where was this superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\" \"All merged in my friendship, Sophia. I would assist any brother officer\\'s wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it. But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself.\" \"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\" \"I might not like them the better for that perhaps. Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\" \"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly. Pray, what would become of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\" \"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth.\" \"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\" \"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife, he will sing a different tune. When he is married, if we have the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many others, have done. We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife.\" \"Ay, that we shall.\" \"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth. \"When once married people begin to attack me with, `Oh! you will think very differently, when you are married.\\' I can only say, `No, I shall not;\\' and then they say again, `Yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\" He got up and moved away. \"What a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft. \"Pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many women have done more. I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar. But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West Indies. We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.\" Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life. \"And I do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates. When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship. While we were together, you know, there was nothing to be feared. Thank God! I have always been blessed with excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me. A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew what sickness was afterwards. The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas. I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\" \"Aye, to be sure. Yes, indeed, oh yes! I am quite of your opinion, Mrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove\\'s hearty answer. \"There is nothing so bad as a separation. I am quite of your opinion. I know what it is, for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are over, and he is safe back again.\" The evening ended with dancing. On its being proposed, Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved. It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth. She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of all the young women, could do. The Miss Hayters, the females of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals. If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could wonder? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together, equally without error, and without consciousness. Once she felt that he was looking at herself, observing her altered features, perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced? The answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing. She had rather play. She is never tired of playing.\" Once, too, he spoke to her. She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of. Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness \"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced to sit down again. Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches. His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything. Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s. He had intended, on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off. There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of Edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer. It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day. The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment. Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies. It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way. Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable, pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth\\'s introduction. He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house, only two miles from Uppercross. A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period, and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners, and of seeing Captain Wentworth. Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters. They had each had money, but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence. Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove\\'s; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest. The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their cousins. Charles\\'s attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation. \"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\" and Henrietta did seem to like him. Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten. Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne\\'s observation reached. Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him. Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance. There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage: the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves\\' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best. Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful. Charles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war. Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy. Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\" \"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary. \"Dear me! If he should rise to any very great honours! If he should ever be made a baronet! `Lady Wentworth\\' sounds very well. That would be a noble thing, indeed, for Henrietta! She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not dislike that. Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth! It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.\" It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to. She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed very sad for herself and her children. \"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away. I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them. And, pray, who is Charles Hayter? Nothing but a country curate. A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross.\" Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw things as an eldest son himself. \"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer. \"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property. The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country. I grant you, that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man good, freehold property. No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\" \"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has. She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday. I wish you had been there to see her behaviour. And as to Captain Wentworth\\'s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best. But Charles is so positive! I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me.\" A dinner at Mr Musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition in little Charles. She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening. As to Captain Wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta. Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife. With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon. Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin\\'s behaviour. She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross: but there was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause. He had been absent only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead. It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it. The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley\\'s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta. When he came back, alas! the zeal of the business was gone by. Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation. \"Well, I am very glad indeed: but I always thought you would have it; I always thought you sure. It did not appear to me that in short, you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise. Is he coming, Louisa?\" One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa. The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived his manners of their usual composure: he started, and could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave. \"They are up stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few moments, I dare say,\" had been Anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself. He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, \"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent. She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule. She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne. She only attempted to say, \"How do you do? Will you not sit down? The others will be here presently.\" Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window. Another minute brought another addition. The younger boy, a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away. There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off. She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain. Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly. \"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment. You are extremely troublesome. I am very angry with you.\" \"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid? Do not you hear your aunt speak? Come to me, Walter, come to cousin Charles.\" But not a bit did Walter stir. In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being released from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it. Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless. She could not even thank him. She could only hang over little Charles, with most disordered feelings. His kindness in stepping forward to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares, and leave the room. She could not stay. It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it. It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth. She had a strong impression of his having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth\\'s interference, \"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself. But neither Charles Hayter\\'s feelings, nor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better arranged her own. She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her. Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur. Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home, where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either. They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love. It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with some. Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them. Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to. She did not attribute guile to any. It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning. There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner. He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter. He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once. After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field. Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a most decided change. He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death. It was Mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to-morrow. Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise. One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion-house. It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes, I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\" Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be communicated, and everything being to be done together, however undesired and inconvenient. She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the interference in any plan of their own. \"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\" said Mary, as she went up stairs. \"Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased, if we had refused to join them. When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\" Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned. They had taken out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early. Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure. Could Anne have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance. Anne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep with her brother and sister. Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling. She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach of Captain Wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves, she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable. It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing, might fall into. He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta. Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister. This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech of Louisa\\'s which struck her. After one of the many praises of the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: \"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister! They meant to take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills. They talked of coming into this side of the country. I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day. Oh! it does happen very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as lieve be tossed out as not.\" \"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were really so, I should do just the same in her place. If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else.\" It was spoken with enthusiasm. \"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\" And there was silence between them for a little while. Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again. The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet, fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together, blessed her memory. She roused herself to say, as they struck by order into another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\" But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her. Winthrop, however, or its environs for young men are, sometimes to be met with, strolling about near home was their destination; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side. Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard. Mary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop. I declare I had no idea! Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\" Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\" cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing the matter warmly. Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently, though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too. But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, \"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short, her look and manner declared, that go she would not. After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations, it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill. Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying to Captain Wentworth \"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions! But, I assure you, I have never been in the house above twice in my life.\" She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile, followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of. The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also. She turned through the same gate, but could not see them. Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other. Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on till she overtook her. Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the centre. They were speaking as they drew near. Louisa\\'s voice was the first distinguished. She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech. What Anne first heard was \"And so, I made her go. I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense. What! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right, by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say? No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded. When I have made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\" \"She would have turned back then, but for you?\" \"She would indeed. I am almost ashamed to say it.\" \"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand! After the hints you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last time I was in company with him, I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on. I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this. Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness, I see. If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can. But this, no doubt, you have been always doing. It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on. You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody may sway it. Let those who would be happy be firm. Here is a nut,\" said he, catching one down from an upper bough. \"to exemplify: a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has outlived all the storms of autumn. Not a puncture, not a weak spot anywhere. This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity, \"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of.\" Then returning to his former earnest tone \"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm. If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind.\" He had done, and was unanswered. It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech: words of such interest, spoken with such serious warmth! She could imagine what Louisa was feeling. For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen. While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her, and they were moving on. Before they were beyond her hearing, however, Louisa spoke again. \"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she; \"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride the Elliot pride. She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride. We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead. I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\" After a moment\\'s pause, Captain Wentworth said \"Do you mean that she refused him?\" \"Oh! yes; certainly.\" \"When did that happen?\" \"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time; but I believe about a year before he married Mary. I wish she had accepted him. We should all have liked her a great deal better; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell\\'s doing, that she did not. They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\" The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more. Her own emotions still kept her fixed. She had much to recover from, before she could move. The listener\\'s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal of very painful import. She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation. As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once more in motion together. Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give. Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured, Charles Hayter with them. The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt. Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased; Charles Hayter exceedingly happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross. Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two. In a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged. She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles\\'s other arm; but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife. Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all. This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit, the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft\\'s gig. He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home. Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross. The invitation was general, and generally declined. The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise. The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again, when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister. The something might be guessed by its effects. \"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft. \"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home. Here is excellent room for three, I assure you. If we were all like you, I believe we might sit four. You must, indeed, you must.\" Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline, she was not allowed to proceed. The Admiral\\'s kind urgency came in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage. Yes; he had done it. She was in the carriage, and felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give her rest. She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent. This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before. She understood him. He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling. Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief. It was a remainder of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed. Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given. They had travelled half their way along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said. She then found them talking of \"Frederick.\" \"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\" said the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which. He has been running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind. Ay, this comes of the peace. If it were war now, he would have settled it long ago. We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war. How many days was it, my dear, between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\" \"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly; \"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together. I had known you by character, however, long before.\" \"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we to wait for besides? I do not like having such things so long in hand. I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch. Then there would always be company for them. And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly know one from the other.\" \"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft, in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; \"and a very respectable family. One could not be connected with better people. My dear Admiral, that post! we shall certainly take that post.\" But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage. The time now approached for Lady Russell\\'s return: the day was even fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it. It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families. This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell. She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere. They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little. These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough. Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there, but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for. The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined. Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away. A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville\\'s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other. Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme. He had been there for four-and-twenty hours. His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither was the consequence. The young people were all wild to see Lyme. Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Wentworth. The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going and returning. They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner. This was felt to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove\\'s coach containing the four ladies, and Charles\\'s curricle, in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone. After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea. They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer. The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better. The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood. The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all, proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth\\'s account: for in a small house, near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled. Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he was to join them on the Cobb. They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long, when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them. Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little history of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies. He had been engaged to Captain Harville\\'s sister, and was now mourning her loss. They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion. Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it. She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea. Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change. He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits. To finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely. Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick\\'s state of mind. The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great. \"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have. I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever. He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man. He will rally again, and be happy with another.\" They all met, and were introduced. Captain Harville was a tall, dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain Wentworth. Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them, a little man. He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation. Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners, was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging. Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them. The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them. There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers. \"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness. On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many. Anne had a moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected. The varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification. Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick. His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within. He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room. Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved. They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being \"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\" and the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn. Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing. The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow, but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers. He ventured among them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general. While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne\\'s lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him. He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion. He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their conversation. For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly. His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances. Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to procure and read them. When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination. Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast. They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted. They praised the morning; gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with \"Oh! yes, I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good. There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring twelve-month. He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again. Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea. I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme. Do not you, Anne? Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley? She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand, in case of his having another seizure. Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out from all the world. I wish his friends would propose it to him. I really think they ought. And, as to procuring a dispensation, there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character. My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish. He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I must say. Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well performed by another person? And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything to complain of.\" Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence? She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married. \"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, \"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley. I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody! I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything! I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.\" Anne was amused by Henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful, and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them. They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town. They were all at her disposal. When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back, and stopped to give them way. They ascended and passed him; and as they passed, Anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of. She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced. It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly. Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it. He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\" After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment. She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant. Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea. It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good manners. He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an agreeable person. Anne felt that she should like to know who he was. They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to the window. It was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle, but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going away. It was driven by a servant in mourning. The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne\\'s curiosity, and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off. \"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne, \"it is the very man we passed.\" The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table. The waiter came into the room soon afterwards. \"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away?\" \"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night from Sidmouth. Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and London.\" \"Elliot!\" Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity of a waiter. \"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot, it must, indeed! Charles, Anne, must not it? In mourning, you see, just as our Mr Elliot must be. How very extraordinary! In the very same inn with us! Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot? my father\\'s next heir? Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter, \"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family?\" \"No, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\" \"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said! Heir to Sir Walter Elliot! I was sure that would come out, if it was so. Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish, wherever he goes. But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary! I wish I had looked at him more. I wish we had been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us. What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance? I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me! Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning, one should have known him by the livery.\" \"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\" said Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\" When she could command Mary\\'s attention, Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable. At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense. She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage, and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret. \"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the next time you write to Bath. I think my father certainly ought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\" Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what ought to be suppressed. The offence which had been given her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth\\'s particular share in it she suspected; and that Mr Elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt. Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne. Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme. They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together, and out of doors as long as they could. Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all fairly in the street. Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side. \"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much. I wish he could have such company oftener. It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is; but what can we do? We cannot part.\" \"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in time, perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction, and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer, I understand.\" \"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\" \"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\" \"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape, just made into the Grappler. I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth. There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm. Nobody could do it, but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.) \"The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being sent to sea again. He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week. That\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James. You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\" Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different. Mrs Harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves. By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found, would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb. Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her. Lord Byron\\'s \"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible. It was soon drawn, perforce another way. There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth. In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the sensation was delightful to her. The hardness of the pavement for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it, however. She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again. He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined I will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless! There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face was like death. The horror of the moment to all who stood around! Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms, looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence. \"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them. \"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strength were gone. \"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him. I can support her myself. Leave me, and go to him. Rub her hands, rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\" Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony \"Oh God! her father and mother!\" \"A surgeon!\" said Anne. He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only \"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away, when Anne eagerly suggested \"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick? He knows where a surgeon is to be found.\" Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother\\'s care, and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity. As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he could not give. Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth. Both seemed to look to her for directions. \"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next? What, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\" Captain Wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her. \"Had not she better be carried to the inn? Yes, I am sure: carry her gently to the inn.\" \"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively collected, and eager to be doing something. \"I will carry her myself. Musgrove, take care of the others.\" By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first report. To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they had passed along. They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them. Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately, informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot. Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done. She must be taken to their house; all must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there. They would not listen to scruples: he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville\\'s direction, was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them. Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without apparent consciousness. This had been a proof of life, however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility. Mary, too, was growing calmer. The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible. They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless. The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries recovered from: he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully. That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may be conceived. The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them. Louisa\\'s limbs had escaped. There was no injury but to the head. It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done, as to their general situation. They were now able to speak to each other and consult. That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble, did not admit a doubt. Her removal was impossible. The Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude. They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect. Captain Benwick must give up his room to them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled. They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room, or swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville\\'s care entirely. Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such another. Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by day or night. And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible. Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror. \"Uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\" At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth, exerting himself, said \"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute. Every minute is valuable. Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly. Musgrove, either you or I must go.\" Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away. He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville; but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would. So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same. She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently. The usefulness of her staying! She who had not been able to remain in Louisa\\'s room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless! She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she was anxious to be at home. The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from Louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door was open. \"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth, \"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home. But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be only one. Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne.\" She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of. The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then appeared. \"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he, turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which seemed almost restoring the past. She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away. She expressed herself most willing, ready, happy to remain. \"It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do. A bed on the floor in Louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.\" One thing more, and all seemed arranged. Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa\\'s night. Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part, and to be soon followed by the two ladies. When the plan was made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it. She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta\\'s stead! Why was not she to be as useful as Anne? And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband! No, it was too unkind. And in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable. Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending to her. She gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along, to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning. There she had listened to Henrietta\\'s schemes for Dr Shirley\\'s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare. Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance. Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa. She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just. Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend. In the mean while she was in the carriage. He had handed them both in, and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme. How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee. It was all quite natural, however. He was devoted to Henrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits. In general, his voice and manner were studiously calm. To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle. Once only, when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as if wholly overcome \"Don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried. \"Oh God! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment! Had I done as I ought! But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\" Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits. She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character. They got on fast. Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon. Their actual speed, heightened by some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day before. It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth. In a low, cautious voice, he said: \"I have been considering what we had best do. She must not appear at first. She could not stand it. I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove. Do you think this is a good plan?\" She did: he was satisfied, and said no more. But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen. When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were baited, he was off. (End of volume one.) The remainder of Anne\\'s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have been difficulties. They had an early account from Lyme the next morning. Louisa was much the same. No symptoms worse than before had appeared. Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account. He was tolerably cheerful. A speedy cure must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted. In speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness, especially of Mrs Harville\\'s exertions as a nurse. \"She really left nothing for Mary to do. He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night. Mary had been hysterical again this morning. When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good. He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\" Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent. It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon. A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa. Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon. They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours. He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his account was still encouraging. The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger. Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in Lyme. Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded. \"What should they do without her? They were wretched comforters for one another.\" And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once. She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved. They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence. She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character. A few days had made a change indeed! If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again. More than former happiness would be restored. There could not be a doubt, to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery. A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne Elliot! An hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart. Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious. It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear. She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had been. Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell\\'s house in September. It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from. Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its mistress. There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell\\'s joy in meeting her. She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross. But happily, either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty. When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change. The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest. She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath. Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick, than her own father\\'s house in Camden Place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy with Mrs Clay. She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her. There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject. They must speak of the accident at Lyme. Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and Captain Wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both. Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell. She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to Lady Russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa. When this was told, his name distressed her no longer. Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt, that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove. The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather improving account of Louisa. At the end of that period, Lady Russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone, \"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon. Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house? It will be some trial to us both.\" Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said, in observing \"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine. By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\" She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners\\'. These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again, and returning through the well-known apartments. In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, \"These rooms ought to belong only to us. Oh, how fallen in their destination! How unworthily occupied! An ancient family to be so driven away! Strangers filling their place!\" No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description to heave. Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving her in that house, there was particular attention. The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting it any more. He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot\\'s not being the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great. This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done. As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how long Miss Musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter! The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming \"Ay, a very bad business indeed. A new sort of way this, for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head, is not it, Miss Elliot? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!\" Admiral Croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell, but they delighted Anne. His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible. \"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from a little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here. I had not recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad. But now, do not stand upon ceremony. Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it.\" \"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\" \"Well, whenever it suits you. You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door. A good place is not it? But,\" (checking himself), \"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the butler\\'s room. Ay, so it always is, I believe. One man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best. And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not.\" Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully. \"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral, after thinking a moment. \"Very few. We told you about the laundry-door, at Uppercross. That has been a very great improvement. The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did, so long! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had. Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better. My wife should have the credit of them, however. I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s. A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection), \"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life. Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away from one\\'s self. So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I never go near.\" Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer, and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up the subject again, to say \"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft\\'s, and say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place. The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three times a winter. And take it altogether, now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we like better than this. Pray say so, with my compliments. He will be glad to hear it.\" Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath. So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall, or of seeing him in company with her friend. Everything was safe enough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject. Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge. They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them. They had been all in lodgings together. Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable. Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer. Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme. She had been taken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight. Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary\\'s face was clouded directly. Charles laughed. \"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd young man. I do not know what he would be at. We asked him to come home with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had `been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come. I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\" Charles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well how it really was. It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.) \"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not courage to come. That is the fact, upon my honour, Mary knows it is.\" But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed. Anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard. She boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries. \"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms \" Mary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there. I declare, Anne, he never talks of you at all.\" \"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly. His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh! I cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then `Miss Elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were in the other room. `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot\\'s charms.\" \"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit, if he did. Miss Harville only died last June. Such a heart is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell? I am sure you will agree with me.\" \"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling. \"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma\\'am,\" said Charles. \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it. I told him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon. So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\" \"Any acquaintance of Anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\" was Lady Russell\\'s kind answer. \"Oh! as to being Anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\" \"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick.\" \"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma\\'am. He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived. He has walked with me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word. He is not at all a well-bred young man. I am sure you will not like him.\" \"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne. \"I think Lady Russell would like him. I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner.\" \"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles. \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him. He is just Lady Russell\\'s sort. Give him a book, and he will read all day long.\" \"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly. \"He will sit poring over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one drop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens. Do you think Lady Russell would like that?\" Lady Russell could not help laughing. \"Upon my word,\" said she, \"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may call myself. I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions. I wish he may be induced to call here. And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.\" \"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\" Lady Russell began talking of something else. Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily. \"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see. His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\" This decision checked Mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance. With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries, there was voluntary communication sufficient. His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected. As Louisa improved, he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week. He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger. He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch. There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time. Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him. Captain Benwick came not, however. He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week\\'s indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite. The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school, bringing with them Mrs Harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme. Henrietta remained with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters. Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again. Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in. Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them. On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise of the others. Charles and Mary also came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children on his knees, generally in vain. It was a fine family-piece. Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken. But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home. Louisa was now recovering apace. Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters went to school again. The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned. Captain Wentworth was gone, for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire. \"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as they were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays.\" Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather than their quantity. When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of pattens, she made no complaint. No, these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness. Anne did not share these feelings. She persisted in a very determined, though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived? And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch. Elizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest. Mr Elliot was in Bath. He had called in Camden Place; had called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive. If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect. This was very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had no wish to see.\" She had a great wish to see him. If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree. Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath. She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street. Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction. Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I leave you again?\" A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome she received, did her good. Her father and sister were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her with kindness. Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage. Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course. Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for. They were evidently in excellent spirits, and she was soon to listen to the causes. They had no inclination to listen to her. After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all their own. Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it was all Bath. They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect. Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste of the furniture. Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after. Everybody was wanting to visit them. They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing. Here were funds of enjoyment. Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy? She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder. But this was not all which they had to make them happy. They had Mr Elliot too. Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot. He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him. He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct, such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was completely re-established. They had not a fault to find in him. He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side. It had originated in misapprehension entirely. He had never had an idea of throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent. Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he was quite indignant. He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day. He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct must refute it. He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject. The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much extenuation. This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it. Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story. She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend. There had been the charm. She had sought him. Without that attraction, not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman. Here was a great deal to soften the business. A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him! Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation. Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place. Anne listened, but without quite understanding it. Allowances, large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke. She heard it all under embellishment. All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators. Still, however, she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well received by them. In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance. In all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title. A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object to him? She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth\\'s sake. There might really have been a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his addresses to her. Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young himself. How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one. Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot\\'s frequent visits were talked of. Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without being much attended to. \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot. They did not know. It might be him, perhaps.\" They could not listen to her description of him. They were describing him themselves; Sir Walter especially. He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse. Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him. He did not mean to complain, however. Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\" Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the whole evening. \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\" and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted. Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman, beautiful. \"He longed to see her. He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets. The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women. He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion. He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being a tolerable face among them. It had been a frosty morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of. But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! they were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced. He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis.\" Modest Sir Walter! He was not allowed to escape, however. His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired. \"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour. \"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day.\" \"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental. In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\" \"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown, or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door suspended everything. \"A knock at the door! and so late! It was ten o\\'clock. Could it be Mr Elliot? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent. It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did. They could think of no one else. Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot\\'s knock.\" Mrs Clay was right. With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered into the room. It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress. Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part must follow then. Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; \"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\" (there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was. He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already. He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only one person\\'s manners. They were not the same, but they were, perhaps, equally good. He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much. There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man. Ten minutes were enough to certify that. His tone, his expressions, his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a sensible, discerning mind. As soon as he could, he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her. She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme. His regret increased as he listened. He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself. If he had but asked who the party were! The name of Musgrove would have told him enough. \"Well, it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious. \"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he, \"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world. The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme. His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place. Having alluded to \"an accident,\" he must hear the whole. When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt. She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it. He staid an hour with them. The elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long. Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well! There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot\\'s being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at home a few hours. On going down to breakfast the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them. She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, \"That must not be any reason, indeed. I assure you I feel it none. She is nothing to me, compared with you;\" and she was in full time to hear her father say, \"My dear madam, this must not be. As yet, you have seen nothing of Bath. You have been here only to be useful. You must not run away from us now. You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis. To your fine mind, I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\" He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself. Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister. The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay. In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher. Had she been using any thing in particular?\" \"No, nothing.\" \"Merely Gowland,\" he supposed. \"No, nothing at all.\" \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\" and added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months. Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her. You see how it has carried away her freckles.\" If Elizabeth could but have heard this! Such personal praise might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened. But everything must take its chance. The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also to marry. As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady Russell. Lady Russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place. The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed. As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more indifferent, towards the others. His manners were an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man. Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart. He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum. He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess. She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage. Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice. Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay. It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation. In Lady Russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of youth. Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\" Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only this cautious reply: \"Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.\" It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation, felt she must submit to. She could determine nothing at present. In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit of such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible. Mr Elliot, too, it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months. A little delay on his side might be very excusable. In fact, Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved. However it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath: she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself. They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times. He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness. She knew it well; and she remembered another person\\'s look also. They did not always think alike. His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers. It was not merely complaisance, it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them. The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. , Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly. Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed. She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears all day long. Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount, when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter\\'s at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch. No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland. The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed. How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question: and it was a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant. \"Family connexions were always worth preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style. She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman. It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\" Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his right honourable cousin. Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess. \"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\" The toils of the business were over, the sweets began. They visited in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible: and \"Our cousins in Laura Place,\" \"Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody. Anne was ashamed. Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created, but they were nothing. There was no superiority of manner, accomplishment, or understanding. Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody. Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth. Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet \"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had their value. Anne smiled and said, \"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.\" \"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company; that is the best. Good company requires only birth, education, and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice. Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well. My cousin Anne shakes her head. She is not satisfied. She is fastidious. My dear cousin\" (sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer? Will it make you happy? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible? You may depend upon it, that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\" \"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\" then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added, \"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance. I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\" \"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims. In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say: but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance.\" \"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place.\" \"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural. But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot. You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little different. In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\" (he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) \"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike. We must feel that every addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\" He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying: a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride, she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her. While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description. She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering. Miss Hamilton, now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable. Anne had gone unhappy to school, grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time; and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference. Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form. She was a widow and poor. Her husband had been extravagant; and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully involved. She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for the present a cripple. She had come to Bath on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society. Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in going. She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she intended, at home. It would excite no proper interest there. She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith\\'s lodgings in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken. The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other more than re-kindled. The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion. Twelve years were gone since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined. Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times. Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation. Neither the dissipations of the past and she had lived very much in the world nor the restrictions of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits. In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and Anne\\'s astonishment increased. She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith\\'s. She had been very fond of her husband: she had buried him. She had been used to affluence: it was gone. She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable. Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath. Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment. How could it be? She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only. A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone. It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want. There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly failed. She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her state on first reaching Bath. Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense. She had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her good. It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands. She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her. \"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance. As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood. She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise. She always takes the right time for applying. Everybody\\'s heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak. She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman. Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received `the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to. Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour\\'s leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that makes one know one\\'s species better. One likes to hear what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly. To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\" Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, \"I can easily believe it. Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to. Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing! And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting. What instances must pass before them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation: of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most. A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes.\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe. Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of. There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\" (speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.\" Anne saw the misery of such feelings. The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved. It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a different tone \"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me. She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery. I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however. She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have in hand now.\" Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place. At last, it became necessary to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings. She was not sorry for the excuse. They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity \"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow.\" They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe. \"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings? A Mrs Smith. A widow Mrs Smith; and who was her husband? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere. And what is her attraction? That she is old and sickly. Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most extraordinary taste! Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting to you. But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow: she is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another day. What is her age? Forty?\" \"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself. She goes into the warm bath to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\" \"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth. \"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary, she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith. \"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter. \"Sir Henry Russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms, but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot. A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings! A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland! Mrs Smith! Such a name!\" Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her. She made no reply. She left it to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity. Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening. She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves, but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her. Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell. To her, its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause. Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot. He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence. He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create. Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot. She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing. She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned. Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed, and gently shook her head. \"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell, \"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations. I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together. A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be a very happy one.\" \"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\" Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me. You are your mother\\'s self in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued! My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life!\" Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table, and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings this picture excited. For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched. The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself; of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist. Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself! she believed, in short, what Anne did not believe. The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again. The charm of Kellynch and of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away. She never could accept him. And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot. Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character. That he was a sensible man, an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough. He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct. She distrusted the past, if not the present. The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been. She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed? Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open. There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of others. This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection. Her early impressions were incurable. She prized the frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others. Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still. She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind never varied, whose tongue never slipped. Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable. Various as were the tempers in her father\\'s house, he pleased them all. He endured too well, stood too well with every body. He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body. Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she saw nothing to excite distrust. She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn. It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme. She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated. It was three weeks since she had heard at all. She only knew that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s compliments. The Crofts must be in Bath! A circumstance to interest her. They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally. \"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter. \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath? The Crofts who rent Kellynch? What have they brought you?\" \"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\" \"Oh! those letters are convenient passports. They secure an introduction. I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate. I know what is due to my tenant.\" Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her. It had been begun several days back. \"February 1st. \"My dear Anne, I make no apology for my silence, because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath. You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords little to write about. We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays. I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody. The holidays, however, are over at last: I believe no children ever had such long ones. I am sure I had not. The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home. Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long. I do not understand it. They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren. What dreadful weather we have had! It may not be felt in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence. I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome. Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way. The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow. We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow. I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have my usual luck: I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family to be noticed. What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth! Does she never mean to go away? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited. Let me know what you think of this. I do not expect my children to be asked, you know. I can leave them at the Great House very well, for a month or six weeks. I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty. Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything. I do not think they improve at all as neighbours. We see nothing of them, and this is really an instance of gross inattention. Charles joins me in love, and everything proper. Yours affectionately, \"Mary M -. \"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about. I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\" So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope, containing nearly as much more. \"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add. In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like. The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants. I shall be truly glad to have them back again. Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family. But now for Louisa. I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little. She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville. True, upon my honour! Are not you astonished? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did. Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter. We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day. Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both. Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her. Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see anything of it. And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours. How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me. I hope he will be more agreeable now. Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.\" Mary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared for the news. She had never in her life been more astonished. Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! It was almost too wonderful for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the moment. Happily for her, they were not many. Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond. \"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, \"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\" \"They come on the Admiral\\'s account. He is thought to be gouty.\" \"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter. \"Poor old gentleman.\" \"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth. \"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft\\'s time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this.\" \"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall. Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\" \"Oh, no! I think not. Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins, we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve. If we were not related, it would not signify; but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours. We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level. There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors. The Crofts will associate with them.\" This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was at liberty. In her own room, she tried to comprehend it. Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel! Perhaps he had quitted the field, had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her. She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend. She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly. Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove! The high-spirited, joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other. Their minds most dissimilar! Where could have been the attraction? The answer soon presented itself. It had been in situation. They had been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same small family party: since Henrietta\\'s coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable. That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself. She did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary might have allowed. She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment. He had an affectionate heart. He must love somebody. She saw no reason against their being happy. Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike. He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they had fallen in love over poetry. The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt of its being so. The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate. The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing to be regretted. No, it was not regret which made Anne\\'s heart beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free. She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate. They were too much like joy, senseless joy! She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them. The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile. The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly to Sir Walter\\'s satisfaction. He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him. The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form, and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure. They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together. He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good. Anne saw them wherever she went. Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them. Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her. She always watched them as long as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted to see the Admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her. Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days after the Croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral. He was standing by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice. When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour. \"Ha! is it you? Thank you, thank you. This is treating me like a friend. Here I am, you see, staring at a picture. I can never get by this shop without stopping. But what a thing here is, by way of a boat! Do look at it. Did you ever see the like? What queer fellows your fine painters must be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be. I wonder where that boat was built!\" (laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it. Well,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound? Can I go anywhere for you, or with you? Can I be of any use?\" \"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together. I am going home.\" \"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too. Yes, yes we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go along. There, take my arm; that\\'s right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there. Lord! what a boat it is!\" taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion. \"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\" \"Yes, I have, presently. But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I shall only say, `How d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however. I shall not stop. `How d\\'ye do?\\' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife. She, poor soul, is tied by the leg. She has a blister on one of her heels, as large as a three-shilling piece. If you look across the street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother. Shabby fellows, both of them! I am glad they are not on this side of the way. Sophy cannot bear them. They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men. I will tell you the whole story another time. There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson. Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife. Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker. Poor old Sir Archibald! How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot? It suits us very well. We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal. We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth. The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\" When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate. She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way. As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began \"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you. But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about. That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned for. The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to. Her Christian name: I always forget her Christian name.\" Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\" \"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name. I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names. I should never be out if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort. Well, this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick. He was courting her week after week. The only wonder was, what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right. But even then there was something odd in their way of going on. Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see Edward. When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since. We have seen nothing of him since November. Even Sophy could not understand it. But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick. You know James Benwick.\" \"A little. I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\" \"Well, she is to marry him. Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for.\" \"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne, \"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\" \"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick. He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of. An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\" \"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick\\'s manners. I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.\" \"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick\\'s manners better than his. There is something about Frederick more to our taste.\" Anne was caught. She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to represent Captain Benwick\\'s manners as the very best that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with \"And the thing is certainly true. It is not a mere bit of gossip. We have it from Frederick himself. His sister had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross. I fancy they are all at Uppercross.\" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore, \"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth\\'s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy. It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally, and without violence. I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\" \"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end.\" Anne looked down to hide her smile. \"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much spirit for that. If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him.\" \"Certainly. But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without its being absolutely said. I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\" \"Yes, yes, I understand you. But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter. He does not give the least fling at Benwick; does not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.\\' No, you would not guess, from his way of writing, that he had ever thought of this Miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself. He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\" Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther. She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way. \"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last. \"Now he must begin all over again with somebody else. I think we must get him to Bath. Sophy must write, and beg him to come to Bath. Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure. It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson. Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\" While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither. Before Mrs Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him. Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay. They were in Milsom Street. It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland\\'s, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance. He soon joined them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes. Her ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four with any comfort. Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies. There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot. Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two. The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot. But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne\\'s; and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest. It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain Wentworth walking down the street. Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and absurd! For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was all confusion. She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay\\'s. She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to see if it rained. Why was she to suspect herself of another motive? Captain Wentworth must be out of sight. She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was. She would see if it rained. She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street. He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite red. For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two. She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments. All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise were over with her. Still, however, she had enough to feel! It was agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery. He spoke to her, and then turned away. The character of his manner was embarrassment. She could not have called it either cold or friendly, or anything so certainly as embarrassed. After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again. Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed: neither of them, probably, much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly. They had by dint of being so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now. Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him. There was consciousness of some sort or other. He looked very well, not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross, of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was. It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him. She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance, expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness. Lady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it. It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot. At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her. \"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them. The carriage would not accommodate so many. I walk: I prefer walking.\" \"But it rains.\" \"Oh! very little, Nothing that I regard.\" After a moment\\'s pause he said: \"Though I came only yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\" (pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair.\" She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding, \"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot. He will be here in a moment, I am sure.\" She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in. Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly. There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend. He came in with eagerness, appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"Good morning to you!\" being all that she had time for, as she passed away. As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth\\'s party began talking of them. \"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\" \"Oh! no, that is clear enough. One can guess what will happen there. He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe. What a very good-looking man!\" \"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\" \"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to look at her. It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire her more than her sister.\" \"Oh! so do I.\" \"And so do I. No comparison. But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot. Anne is too delicate for them.\" Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word. She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay. But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth. She could not understand his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled, she could not be quite herself. She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet. Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not recollect it. He might be only passing through. But it was more probable that he should be come to stay. In that case, so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere. Would she recollect him? How would it all be? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick. It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him. The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street. There were many other men about him, many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him. She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself. No, it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite. She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out, though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him of her being, in short, intently observing him. She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell\\'s mind, the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace! At last, Lady Russell drew back her head. \"Now, how would she speak of him?\" \"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long; but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night. They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\" Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her friend or herself. The part which provoked her most, was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them. A day or two passed without producing anything. The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening. It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple. Of course they must attend. It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music. If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred. Elizabeth had turned from him, Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention. She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow. Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence. \"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come. Who is your party?\" Anne named them all. Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, \"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you.\" Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away. Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room. But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone. Anne was the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke. He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\" brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground. Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done. While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear. She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself. This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than nothing, and her spirits improved. After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert, their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little smile, a little glow, he said \"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme. I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you at the time.\" She assured him that she had not. \"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added, \"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful. When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\" \"Certainly I could have none. But it appears I should hope it would be a very happy match. There are on both sides good principles and good temper.\" \"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think, ends the resemblance. With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it. They have no difficulties to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays. The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly, only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort. All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps \" He stopped. A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne\\'s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground. After clearing his throat, however, he proceeded thus \"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity, and in a point no less essential than mind. I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more. He is a clever man, a reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise. Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it would have been another thing. But I have no reason to suppose it so. It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me. A man like him, in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was indeed attachment. A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman. He ought not; he does not.\" Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered, or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who, in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a moment. It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say \"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\" \"About a fortnight. I could not leave it till Louisa\\'s doing well was quite ascertained. I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace. It had been my doing, solely mine. She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak. The country round Lyme is very fine. I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\" \"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne. \"Indeed! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling. The horror and distress you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.\" \"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne; \"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure. One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at Lyme. We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment. So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections), \"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\" As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting. \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\" was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her. Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant, advanced into the room. The others joined them, and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included. She was divided from Captain Wentworth. Their interesting, almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on! She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations. She was in good humour with all. She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself. The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw that he was gone. She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room. He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment\\'s regret. But \"they should meet again. He would look for her, he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as well to be asunder. She was in need of a little interval for recollection.\" Upon Lady Russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people as they could. Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in. Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach; and Anne but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison between it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other all generous attachment. Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room. Her happiness was from within. Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed; but she knew nothing about it. She was thinking only of the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty range over it. His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light. His opinion of Louisa Musgrove\\'s inferiority, an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness of the past. Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past. She could not contemplate the change as implying less. He must love her. These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even trying to discern him. When their places were determined on, and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way. The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well, with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her. Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object of Colonel Wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented. Anne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening; it was just occupation enough: she had feelings for the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least during the first act. Towards the close of it, in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot. They had a concert bill between them. \"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand the language. I am a very poor Italian scholar.\" \"Yes, yes, I see you are. I see you know nothing of the matter. You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear, comprehensible, elegant English. You need not say anything more of your ignorance. Here is complete proof.\" \"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient.\" \"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\" replied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman.\" \"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery. I forget what we are to have next,\" turning to the bill. \"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of.\" \"Indeed! How so? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family.\" \"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath. I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately. I have been acquainted with you by character many years. Your person, your disposition, accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise. No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery. To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity. She wondered, and questioned him eagerly; but in vain. He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell. \"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now. He would mention no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact. He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the warmest curiosity to know her.\" Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth\\'s brother. He might have been in Mr Elliot\\'s company, but she had not courage to ask the question. \"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\" Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial. Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking. \"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\" \"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple. \"More air than one often sees in Bath. Irish, I dare say.\" \"No, I just know his name. A bowing acquaintance. Wentworth; Captain Wentworth of the navy. His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\" Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne\\'s eyes had caught the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance. As her eyes fell on him, his seemed to be withdrawn from her. It had that appearance. It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe, he did not look again: but the performance was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward. When she could give another glance, he had moved away. He could not have come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in: but she would rather have caught his eye. Mr Elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her. She had no longer any inclination to talk to him. She wished him not so near her. The first act was over. Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did decide on going in quest of tea. Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move. She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean, whatever she might feel on Lady Russell\\'s account, to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity. She was persuaded by Lady Russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him. He did not come however. Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance, but he never came. The anxious interval wore away unproductively. The others returned, the room filled again, benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed. To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation. She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without the interchange of one friendly look. In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which was favourable for her. Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals, and a little scheming of her own, Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much more within reach of a passer-by. She could not do so, without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but still she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed. Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth was again in sight. She saw him not far off. He saw her too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her. She felt that something must be the matter. The change was indubitable. The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great. Why was it? She thought of her father, of Lady Russell. Could there have been any unpleasant glances? He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over. Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance improved, and he replied again with almost a smile. They talked for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round. It came from Mr Elliot. He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain Italian again. Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung. Anne could not refuse; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit. A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell. \"He must wish her good night; he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\" \"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging. \"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\" and he was gone directly. Jealousy of Mr Elliot! It was the only intelligible motive. Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection! Could she have believed it a week ago; three hours ago! For a moment the gratification was exquisite. But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed. How was such jealousy to be quieted? How was the truth to reach him? How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he ever learn of her real sentiments? It was misery to think of Mr Elliot\\'s attentions. Their evil was incalculable. Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object. She felt a great deal of good-will towards him. In spite of the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhaps compassion. She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession. It was altogether very extraordinary; flattering, but painful. There was much to regret. How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case, was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be his for ever. Their union, she believed, could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation. Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings. It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way. She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her, though it had been an appointment. An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne\\'s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it. All that she could tell she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter, rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company. Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith. \"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed. They never miss a concert.\" \"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room.\" \"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\" \"I do not know. I do not think they were.\" \"Old Lady Mary Maclean? I need not ask after her. She never misses, I know; and you must have seen her. She must have been in your own circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur, round the orchestra, of course.\" \"No, that was what I dreaded. It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect. But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.\" \"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement. I can understand. There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this you had. You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing beyond.\" \"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that the object only had been deficient. \"No, no; you were better employed. You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening. I see it in your eye. I perfectly see how the hours passed: that you had always something agreeable to listen to. In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\" Anne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\" \"Yes, I do. Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together.\" A blush overspread Anne\\'s cheeks. She could say nothing. \"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, \"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning. It is really very good of you to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.\" Anne heard nothing of this. She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her. After another short silence \"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me? Does he know that I am in Bath?\" \"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised. A moment\\'s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under. She caught it instantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added, more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\" \"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely, \"but it seems worn out now. It is a great while since we met.\" \"I was not at all aware of this. You never mentioned it before. Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\" \"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual air of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have. I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot. I want your interest with him. He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness, my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is done.\" \"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater right to influence him, than is really the case. I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion. You must consider me only as Mr Elliot\\'s relation. If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\" Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said \"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon. I ought to have waited for official information, But now, my dear Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak. Next week? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot\\'s good fortune.\" \"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next. I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week. I am not going to marry Mr Elliot. I should like to know why you imagine I am?\" Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her head, and exclaimed \"Now, how I do wish I understood you! How I do wish I knew what you were at! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when the right moment occurs. Till it does come, you know, we women never mean to have anybody. It is a thing of course among us, that every man is refused, till he offers. But why should you be cruel? Let me plead for my present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend. Where can you look for a more suitable match? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man? Let me recommend Mr Elliot. I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?\" \"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above half a year. He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one.\" \"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly, \"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him. Do not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all. Let him know me to be a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps. Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same. Of course, he cannot be aware of the importance to me. Well, my dear Miss Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy. Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman. Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been. You are safe in all worldly matters, and safe in his character. He will not be led astray; he will not be misled by others to his ruin.\" \"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin. He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous impressions. I consider him with great respect. I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise. But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be known intimately soon. Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me? Surely this must be calm enough. And, upon my word, he is nothing to me. Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him. I assure you I shall not. I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford: not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that \" She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much; but less would hardly have been sufficient. Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception of there being a somebody else. As it was, she instantly submitted, and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it. \"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\" \"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way. But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\" \"And has it indeed been spoken of?\" \"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday?\" \"No. Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid? I observed no one in particular.\" \"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in. She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot. She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority. She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\" \"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing. \"She could not make a very long history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.\" Mrs Smith said nothing. \"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could. Shall I mention to him your being in Bath? Shall I take any message?\" \"No, I thank you: no, certainly not. In the warmth of the moment, and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances; but not now. No, I thank you, I have nothing to trouble you with.\" \"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\" \"I did.\" \"Not before he was married, I suppose?\" \"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\" \"And were you much acquainted?\" \"Intimately.\" \"Indeed! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life. I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man. Was he at all such as he appears now?\" \"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s answer, given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity. They were both silent: Mrs Smith very thoughtful. At last \"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her natural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do. I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you. There were many things to be taken into the account. One hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief. Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may be nothing durable beneath. However, I have determined; I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot\\'s real character. Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may happen. You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards him. Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced. Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character. He has no feeling for others. Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction. He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion. Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\" Anne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and in a calmer manner, she added, \"My expressions startle you. You must allow for an injured, angry woman. But I will try to command myself. I will not abuse him. I will only tell you what I have found him. Facts shall speak. He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself. The intimacy had been formed before our marriage. I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion of him. At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together. We were principally in town, living in very good style. He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman. He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother. My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\" \"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot\\'s life,\" said Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity. It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister. I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with present times. It seemed to announce a different sort of man.\" \"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith. \"He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him, but I heard him speak of them for ever. I know he was invited and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go. I can satisfy you, perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage, I knew all about it at the time. I was privy to all the fors and againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer any question you may wish to put.\" \"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her. I have always understood they were not a happy couple. But I should like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father\\'s acquaintance as he did. My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him. Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\" \"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life, had one object in view: to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process than the law. He was determined to make it by marriage. He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence. That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you. He told me the whole story. He had no concealments with me. It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father and sister. He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other.\" \"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot?\" \"To be sure I did; very often. I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot, and vouch for your being a very different creature from \" She checked herself just in time. \"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\" cried Anne. \"This explains it. I found he had been used to hear of me. I could not comprehend how. What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned! How sure to be mistaken! But I beg your pardon; I have interrupted you. Mr Elliot married then completely for money? The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his character.\" Mrs Smith hesitated a little here. \"Oh! those things are too common. When one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought. I was very young, and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any strict rules of conduct. We lived for enjoyment. I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing. `To do the best for himself,\\' passed as a duty.\" \"But was not she a very low woman?\" \"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard. Money, money, was all that he wanted. Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been a butcher, but that was all nothing. She was a fine woman, had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance into Mr Elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her birth. All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself. Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it. His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt. I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject. It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\" \"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne. \"You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago. This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe. I am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\" \"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary; stay: I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\" Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired. The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it as she unlocked it, said \"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him. The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine. But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed. Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy. I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it.\" This was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\" and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: \"Dear Smith, I have received yours. Your kindness almost overpowers me. I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it. At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in cash again. Give me joy: I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer. The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough. If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion. He is worse than last year. \"I wish I had any name but Elliot. I am sick of it. The name of Walter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only yours truly, Wm. Elliot.\" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said \"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful. Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning. But it shows you the man. Mark his professions to my poor husband. Can any thing be stronger?\" Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father. She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over, and say \"Thank you. This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you were saying. But why be acquainted with us now?\" \"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling. \"Can you really?\" \"Yes. I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I will shew him as he is now. I cannot produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now wanting, and what he is now doing. He is no hypocrite now. He truly wants to marry you. His present attentions to your family are very sincere: quite from the heart. I will give you my authority: his friend Colonel Wallis.\" \"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\" \"No. It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence. The stream is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away. Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her. She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me. On Monday evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings. When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.\" \"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient. This will not do. Mr Elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father. That was all prior to my coming to Bath. I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived.\" \"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but \" \"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such a line. Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly have much truth left.\" \"Only give me a hearing. You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm. Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement. He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without knowing it to be you. So says my historian, at least. Is this true? Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\' to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\" \"He certainly did. So far it is very true. At Lyme. I happened to be at Lyme.\" \"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted. He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there. But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain. If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me. My account states, that your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter\\'s acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\" Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she continued \"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail. Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot\\'s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy. Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man. Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to. I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling. He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William. You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material. This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could. He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced. Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay. He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject. You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\" \"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known, or could imagine. There is always something offensive in the details of cunning. The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me. I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied. I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared. I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not.\" \"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith. \"He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence. But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence. Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay. A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. `Why, to be sure, ma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\' And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter\\'s making a second match. She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis\\'s recommendation?\" \"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little thoughtfulness. \"It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do. My line of conduct will be more direct. Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness.\" But Mr Elliot was not done with. Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice and compassion. She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune. Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance. From his wife\\'s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him, led by him, and probably despised by him. Mr Elliot, raised by his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined. The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it. They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot\\'s had better not be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known. With a confidence in Mr Elliot\\'s regard, more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act, and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her, in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to without corresponding indignation. Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her. It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse. She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence. Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s usual state of mind. There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation. She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this property, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively rich. But there was nobody to stir in it. Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money. She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law. This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means. To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims, was hard to bear. It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne\\'s good offices with Mr Elliot. She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne\\'s feelings, as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot\\'s character would allow, when Anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way. After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation. \"She had seemed to recommend and praise him!\" \"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done. I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband. My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless. He was very unkind to his first wife. They were wretched together. But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her. I was willing to hope that you must fare better.\" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed. It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell! And under such a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too late? It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference, which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved. Anne went home to think over all that she had heard. In one point, her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot. There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him. He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed. Pity for him was all over. But this was the only point of relief. In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw more to distrust and to apprehend. She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to avert any one of them. She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him. She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed springing from it! Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done. Could the knowledge have been extended through her family? But this was a vain idea. She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself. She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening. \"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth, with affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at least.\" \"Indeed, I do say it. I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation. Poor man! I was really in pain for him; for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\" \"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints. However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together. They appear to so much advantage in company with each other. Each behaving so pleasantly. Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\" \"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her eyes towards Anne. \"Exactly like father and son! Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?\" \"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body\\'s words. If you will have such ideas! But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men.\" \"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes, and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence. \"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him. I did invite him, you know. I sent him away with smiles. When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\" Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object. It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise. To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her. She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but now she saw insincerity in everything. His attentive deference to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his artificial good sentiments. She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side. It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along. She was accordingly more guarded, and more cool, than she had been the night before. He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others. He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable. She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part of two days. He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain. It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort. It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them! Mrs Clay\\'s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot\\'s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it. On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion. She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street. \"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love. Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through. I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out. Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications. You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night. I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the concert. Something so formal and arrange in her air! and she sits so upright! My best love, of course.\" \"And mine,\" added Sir Walter. \"Kindest regards. And you may say, that I mean to call upon her soon. Make a civil message; but I shall only leave my card. Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little. If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\" While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door. Who could it be? Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off. After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard, and \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered into the room. Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well. They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the White Hart. So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw upon Charles\\'s brain for a regular history of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of. She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and Captain Harville, beside their two selves. He gave her a very plain, intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding. The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville\\'s wanting to come to Bath on business. He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end. But then, it had been taken up by his father and mother. His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being his mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience. They had arrived late the night before. Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross. Anne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of. She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very recently, (since Mary\\'s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa\\'s. \"And a very good living it was,\" Charles added: \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire. In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation. Not that he will value it as he ought,\" he observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That\\'s the worst of him.\" \"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well, and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort. I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\" \"Oh! yes. My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer, but he has no other fault to find. Money, you know, coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation, and it streightens him as to many things. However, I do not mean to say they have not a right to it. It is very fit they should have daughters\\' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind, liberal father to me. Mary does not above half like Henrietta\\'s match. She never did, you know. But she does not do him justice, nor think enough about Winthrop. I cannot make her attend to the value of the property. It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\" \"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne, \"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages. They do everything to confer happiness, I am sure. What a blessing to young people to be in such hands! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery, both in young and old. I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now?\" He answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing or dancing; it is quite different. If one happens only to shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her, all day long.\" Anne could not help laughing. \"That cannot be much to your taste, I know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\" \"To be sure he is. Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself. I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say. His reading has done him no harm, for he has fought as well as read. He is a brave fellow. I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before. We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since.\" Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles\\'s following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it. She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs. The visit passed off altogether in high good humour. Mary was in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they were detailed to her. She had no demands on her father or sister, and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms. Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal. She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch. It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then Elizabeth was happy again. These were her internal persuasions: \"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month: and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of her way. I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy with us. I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat. They have not seen two such drawing rooms before. They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening. It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.\" And this satisfied Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two present, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied. She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention. Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her and Henrietta directly. Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present. They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but Anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form. They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and Anne had the kindest welcome from each. Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove\\'s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress. It was a heartiness, and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad want of such blessings at home. She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on Charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove\\'s history of Louisa, and to Henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts; from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining. A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected. A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene. One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth. The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment. It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again. Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed. He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation. She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence: \"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand each other ere long. We are not boy and girl, to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence, and wantonly playing with our own happiness.\" And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind. \"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay, I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her. I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now. They seemed deep in talk. Who is it? Come, and tell me. Good heavens! I recollect. It is Mr Elliot himself.\" \"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you. He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till to-morrow.\" As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret that she had said so much, simple as it was. Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin, began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to be cool and unconcerned. Her distress returned, however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret. It was evident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther. \"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself. You will be too late if you do not make haste. They are parting; they are shaking hands. He is turning away. Not know Mr Elliot, indeed! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme.\" To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move quietly to the window. She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly. He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair, recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well. The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with \"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like. I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night. A\\'n\\'t I a good boy? I know you love a play; and there is room for us all. It holds nine. I have engaged Captain Wentworth. Anne will not be sorry to join us, I am sure. We all like a play. Have not I done well, mother?\" Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming \"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing? Take a box for to-morrow night! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them? How can you be so forgetful?\" \"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what\\'s an evening party? Never worth remembering. Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he had wanted to see us. You may do as you like, but I shall go to the play.\" \"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you promised to go.\" \"No, I did not promise. I only smirked and bowed, and said the word `happy.\\' There was no promise.\" \"But you must go, Charles. It would be unpardonable to fail. We were asked on purpose to be introduced. There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves. Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately. We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot. Consider, my father\\'s heir: the future representative of the family.\" \"Don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles. \"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun. If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir. What is Mr Elliot to me?\" The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself. Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she, invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play without her. Mrs Musgrove interposed. \"We had better put it off. Charles, you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday. It would be a pity to be divided, and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play, if Miss Anne could not be with us.\" Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying \"If it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home (excepting on Mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment. I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it for a play, and with you. But, it had better not be attempted, perhaps.\" She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to try to observe their effect. It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would. Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne. \"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy the evening parties of the place.\" \"Oh! no. The usual character of them has nothing for me. I am no card-player.\" \"You were not formerly, I know. You did not use to like cards; but time makes many changes.\" \"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction. After waiting a few moments he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, \"It is a period, indeed! Eight years and a half is a period.\" Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne\\'s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in. They were obliged to move. Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity her. Their preparations, however, were stopped short. Alarming sounds were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill. Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same. The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister. How mortifying to feel that it was so! Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular. Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before. She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once. Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure. The sequel explained it. After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves. \"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends: no formal party.\" It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth. The truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his. The past was nothing. The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing-room. The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared. The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not to Anne. She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance. She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for all the insolence of the past. Her spirits sank. He held the card in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it. \"Only think of Elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered Mary very audibly. \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted! You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\" Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her. The party separated. The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne belonged to them. She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose. Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not? They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together. She generally thought he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings. She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation, to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay\\'s face as she listened. It was transient: cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter. She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature: \"Oh! dear! very true. Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street. I was never more astonished. He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard. He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return. He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow. He was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head.\" One day only had passed since Anne\\'s conversation with Mrs Smith; but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street. She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner. Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot\\'s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade\\'s head, must live another day. She could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to attempt the walk. When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive. The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned. She had only to submit, sit down, be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed. There was no delay, no waste of time. She was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such happiness, instantly. Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said \"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you will give me materials.\" Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing. Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper. Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as, \"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals. Mrs Croft was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly. Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear. \"And so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them. At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\" \"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft. \"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in a long engagement. I always think that no mutual \" \"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her finish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement. It is what I always protested against for my children. It is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement \" \"Yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement, an engagement which may be long. To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.\" Anne found an unexpected interest here. She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her. The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion. Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood. He looked at her with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, \"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation. She roused herself and went to him. The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain Wentworth\\'s table, not very near. As she joined him, Captain Harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character. \"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\" \"Certainly: Captain Benwick.\" \"Yes, and you may guess who it is for. But,\" (in a deep tone,) \"it was not done for her. Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him? I little thought then but no matter. This was drawn at the Cape. He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another! It was a commission to me! But who else was there to employ? I hope I can allow for him. I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another. He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,) \"he is writing about it now.\" And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\" \"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\" \"It was not in her nature. She doted on him.\" \"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\" Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that for your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also, \"Yes. We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us. It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\" \"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men (which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to Benwick. He has not been forced upon any exertion. The peace turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our little family circle, ever since.\" \"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we say now, Captain Harville? If the change be not from outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man\\'s nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\" \"No, no, it is not man\\'s nature. I will not allow it to be more man\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved. I believe the reverse. I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.\" \"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender. Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments. Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise. You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with. You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship. Your home, country, friends, all quitted. Neither time, nor health, nor life, to be called your own. It would be hard, indeed\" (with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be added to all this.\" \"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room. It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could have caught. \"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville. \"Not quite, a few lines more. I shall have done in five minutes.\" \"There is no hurry on my side. I am only ready whenever you are. I am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied, and want for nothing. No hurry for a signal at all. Well, Miss Elliot,\" (lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose, upon this point. No man and woman, would, probably. But let me observe that all histories are against you all stories, prose and verse. If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman\\'s inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman\\'s fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.\" \"Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.\" \"But how shall we prove anything?\" \"We never shall. We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point. It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof. We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said.\" \"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, \"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!\\' And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself, and saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still! If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence! I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own with emotion. \"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you, and by those who resemble you. God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman. No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives. I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as if I may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object. I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you. All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.\" She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed. \"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on her arm, quite affectionately. \"There is no quarrelling with you. And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\" Their attention was called towards the others. Mrs Croft was taking leave. \"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she. \"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend. To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\" (turning to Anne.) \"We had your sister\\'s card yesterday, and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either could not or would not answer fully. \"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a minute. I know you will not be sorry to be off. I shall be at your service in half a minute.\" Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone. Anne knew not how to understand it. She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\" from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look! He had passed out of the room without a look! She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it was himself. He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it: the work of an instant! The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond expression. The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to \"Miss A. E. ,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily. While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been also addressing her! On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her. Anything was possible, anything might be defied rather than suspense. Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following words: \"I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W. \"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father\\'s house this evening or never.\" Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from. Half and hour\\'s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity. Every moment rather brought fresh agitation. It was overpowering happiness. And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in. The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more. She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself. They could then see that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her for the world. This was dreadful. Would they only have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home. \"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly, and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening. I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself. Charles, ring and order a chair. She must not walk.\" But the chair would never do. Worse than all! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet, solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him) could not be borne. The chair was earnestly protested against, and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at night. Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said \"I am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood. Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening. I am afraid there had been some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\" \"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word. Captain Harville has no thought but of going.\" \"Do you think so? But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry. Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again? You will see them both this morning, I dare say. Do promise me.\" \"To be sure I will, if you wish it. Charles, if you see Captain Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne\\'s message. But indeed, my dear, you need not be uneasy. Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged, I\\'ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\" Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity. It could not be very lasting, however. Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville. Another momentary vexation occurred. Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him. This was almost cruel. But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s, to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent. They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth. He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked. Anne could command herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively. The cheeks which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated were decided. He walked by her side. Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said \"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going? Only to Gay Street, or farther up the town?\" \"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised. \"Are you going as high as Belmont? Are you going near Camden Place? Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father\\'s door. She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the Market Place. He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance. By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day round Winthrop.\" There could not be an objection. There could be only the most proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture. In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding together: and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow. There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so many, many years of division and estrangement. There they returned again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting. And there, as they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest. All the little variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end. She had not mistaken him. Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment. That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last four-and-twenty hours. It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings. Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified. He persisted in having loved none but her. She had never been supplanted. He never even believed himself to see her equal. Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge: that he had been constant unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it to be done. He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been a sufferer from them. Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself. At Lyme, he had received lessons of more than one sort. The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville\\'s had fixed her superiority. In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own. There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind. There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way. From that period his penance had become severe. He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty. \"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment. I was startled and shocked. To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family, nay, perhaps herself I was no longer at my own disposal. I was hers in honour if she wished it. I had been unguarded. I had not thought seriously on this subject before. I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects. I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\" He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed. It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere. He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore, to his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require. \"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy. I could have no other pleasure. I deserved none. He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\" Anne smiled, and let it pass. It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach. It is something for a woman to be assured, in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment. He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick. \"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something. But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful. Within the first five minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,\\' and I was. Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope? You were single. It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine. I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, `Was this for me?\\'\" Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the concert still more. That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments. The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him: the moment of Mr Elliot\\'s appearing and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy. \"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared? How could I look on without agony? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me?\" \"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne. \"You should not have suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different. If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk. When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here. In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.\" \"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not. I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character. I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year. I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me. I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery. I had no reason to believe her of less authority now. The force of habit was to be added.\" \"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this.\" \"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give. I left you in this belief; and yet, I was determined to see you again. My spirits rallied with the morning, and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\" At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house could have conceived. All the surprise and suspense, and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last. An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment. The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled. It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found an evening shorter. Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her. Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him. The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them. Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret they would soon be innoxious cousins to her. She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister. With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there. It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said \"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now. To me, she was in the place of a parent. Do not mistake me, however. I am not saying that she did not err in her advice. It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice. But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience. I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\" He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her, replied, as if in cool deliberation \"Not yet. But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time. I trust to being in charity with her soon. But I too have been thinking over the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady? My own self. Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter? Would you, in short, have renewed the engagement then?\" \"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough. \"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would! It is not that I did not think of it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I was proud, too proud to ask again. I did not understand you. I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice. This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself. Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared. It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me. I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed. I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards. Like other great men under reverses,\" he added, with a smile. \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune. I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\" Who can be in doubt of what followed? When any two young people take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort. This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing down every opposition? They might in fact, have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth. Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned. Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him, was no longer nobody. He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter. Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from thinking it a bad match for her. On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour. The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell. Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do justice to Captain Wentworth. This however was what Lady Russell had now to do. She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth\\'s manners had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind. There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes. There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend. But she was a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy. She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child. Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance. It was creditable to have a sister married, and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters, it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter. She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation. Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne. It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation, for a change is not very probable there. She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him. The news of his cousins Anne\\'s engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly. It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given. But, though discomfited and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment. He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay\\'s quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman, at least. Mrs Clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed, for the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter. She has abilities, however, as well as affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William. It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their deception in her. They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of half enjoyment. Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell\\'s meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value. There she felt her own inferiority very keenly. The disproportion in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity. She had but two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs Smith. To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself. Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now value from his heart. While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently. Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her two. She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband\\'s property in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully requited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife. Mrs Smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income, with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity. She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be happy. Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her friend Anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart. Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth\\'s affection. His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine. She gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife, but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance.

       "'[Stories to Tell to Children by Sara Cone Bryant 1918] \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTWO LITTLE RIDDLES IN RHYME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     There\\'s a garden that I ken,\\r\\n     Full of little gentlemen;\\r\\n     Little caps of blue they wear,\\r\\n     And green ribbons, very fair.\\r\\n           (Flax.)\\r\\n\\r\\n     From house to house he goes,\\r\\n     A messenger small and slight,\\r\\n     And whether it rains or snows,\\r\\n     He sleeps outside in the night.\\r\\n           (The path.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE YELLOW TULIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a little yellow Tulip, and she lived down in a little\\r\\ndark house under the ground. One day she was sitting there, all by\\r\\nherself, and it was very still. Suddenly, she heard a little _tap, tap,\\r\\ntap_, at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is that?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Rain, and I want to come in,\" said a soft, sad, little voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you can\\'t come in,\" the little Tulip said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by she heard another little _tap, tap, tap_ on the window-pane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same soft little voice answered, \"It\\'s the Rain, and I want to come\\r\\nin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you can\\'t come in,\" said the little Tulip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was very still for a long time. At last, there came a little\\r\\nrustling, whispering sound, all round the window: _rustle, whisper,\\r\\nwhisper_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" said the little Tulip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Sunshine,\" said a little, soft, cheery voice, \"and I want to\\r\\ncome in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"N--no,\" said the little Tulip, \"you can\\'t come in.\" And she sat still\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty soon she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the keyhole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Sunshine,\" said the cheery little voice, \"and I want to come\\r\\nin, I want to come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said the little Tulip, \"you cannot come in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, as she sat so still, she heard _tap, tap, tap_, and _rustle,\\r\\nwhisper, rustle_, up and down the window-pane, and on the door and at\\r\\nthe keyhole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Who is there?_\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Rain and the Sun, the Rain and the Sun,\" said two little\\r\\nvoices, together, \"and we want to come in! We want to come in! We want\\r\\nto come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear!\" said the little Tulip, \"if there are two of you, I s\\'pose\\r\\nI shall have to let you in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she opened the door a little wee crack, and in they came. And one\\r\\ntook one of her little hands, and the other took her other little hand,\\r\\nand they ran, ran, ran with her right up to the top of the ground. Then\\r\\nthey said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poke your head through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she poked her head through; and she was in the midst of a beautiful\\r\\ngarden. It was early springtime, and few other flowers were to be seen;\\r\\nbut she had the birds to sing to her and the sun to shine upon her\\r\\npretty yellow head. She was so pleased, too, when the children exclaimed\\r\\nwith pleasure that now they knew that the beautiful spring had come!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COCK-A-DOO-DLE-DOO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA very little boy made this story up \"out of his head,\" and told it to\\r\\nhis papa. I think you littlest ones will like it; I do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy, and he wanted to be a\\r\\ncock-a-doo-dle-doo. So he was a cock-a-doo-dle-doo. And he wanted to fly\\r\\nup into the sky. So he did fly up into the sky. And he wanted to get\\r\\nwings and a tail So he did get some wings and a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CLOUD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hot summer morning a little Cloud rose out of the sea and floated\\r\\nlightly and happily across the blue sky. Far below lay the earth, brown,\\r\\ndry, and desolate, from drought. The little Cloud could see the poor\\r\\npeople of the earth working and suffering in the hot fields, while she\\r\\nherself floated on the morning breeze, hither and thither, without a\\r\\ncare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if I could only help the poor people down there!\" she thought. \"If\\r\\nI could but make their work easier, or give the hungry ones food, or the\\r\\nthirsty a drink!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as the day passed, and the Cloud became larger, this wish to do\\r\\nsomething for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn earth it grew hotter and hotter; the sun burned down so fiercely that\\r\\nthe people were fainting in its rays; it seemed as if they must die of\\r\\nheat, and yet they were obliged to go on with their work, for they were\\r\\nvery poor. Sometimes they stood and looked up at the Cloud, as if they\\r\\nwere praying, and saying, \"Ah, if you could help us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will help you; I will!\" said the Cloud. And she began to sink softly\\r\\ndown toward the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly, as she floated down, she remembered something which had\\r\\nbeen told her when she was a tiny Cloud-child, in the lap of Mother\\r\\nOcean: it had been whispered that if the Clouds go too near the earth\\r\\nthey die. When she remembered this she held herself from sinking, and\\r\\nswayed here and there on the breeze, thinking,--thinking. But at last\\r\\nshe stood quite still, and spoke boldly and proudly. She said, \"Men of\\r\\nearth, I will help you, come what may!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought made her suddenly marvellously big and strong and powerful.\\r\\nNever had she dreamed that she could be so big. Like a mighty angel of\\r\\nblessing she stood above the earth, and lifted her head and spread her\\r\\nwings far over the fields and woods. She was so great, so majestic, that\\r\\nmen and animals were awe-struck at the sight; the trees and the grasses\\r\\nbowed before her; yet all the earth-creatures felt that she meant them\\r\\nwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I will help you,\" cried the Cloud once more. \"Take me to\\r\\nyourselves; I will give my life for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said the words a wonderful light glowed from her heart, the sound\\r\\nof thunder rolled through the sky, and a love greater than words can\\r\\ntell filled the Cloud; down, down, close to the earth she swept, and\\r\\ngave up her life in a blessed, healing shower of rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat rain was the Cloud\\'s great deed; it was her death, too; but it was\\r\\nalso her glory. Over the whole country-side, as far as the rain fell, a\\r\\nlovely rainbow sprang its arch, and all the brightest rays of heaven\\r\\nmade its colours; it was the last greeting of a love so great that it\\r\\nsacrificed itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon that, too, was gone, but long, long afterward the men and animals\\r\\nwho were saved by the Cloud kept her blessing in their hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE RED HEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Red Hen was in the farmyard with her chickens, when she found\\r\\na grain of wheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who will plant this wheat?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen, and she planted the grain of\\r\\nwheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wheat was ripe she said, \"Who will take this wheat to the\\r\\nmill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen, and she took the wheat to the\\r\\nmill.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she brought the flour home she said, \"Who will make some bread with\\r\\nthis flour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the bread was baked, she said, \"Who will eat this bread?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you won\\'t,\" said the little Red Hen. \"I shall eat it myself. Cluck!\\r\\ncluck!\" And she called her chickens to help her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GINGERBREAD MAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man, and\\r\\nthey lived all alone in a little old house. They hadn\\'t any little\\r\\ngirls or any little boys, at all. So one day, the little old woman made\\r\\na boy out of gingerbread; she made him a chocolate jacket, and put\\r\\nraisins on it for buttons; his eyes were made of fine, fat currants; his\\r\\nmouth was made of rose-coloured sugar; and he had a gay little cap of\\r\\norange sugar-candy. When the little old woman had rolled him out, and\\r\\ndressed him up, and pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape, she put\\r\\nhim in a pan; then she put the pan in the oven and shut the door; and\\r\\nshe thought, \"Now I shall have a little boy of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was time for the Gingerbread Boy to be done she opened the oven\\r\\ndoor and pulled out the pan. Out jumped the little Gingerbread Boy on to\\r\\nthe floor, and away he ran, out of the door and down the street! The\\r\\nlittle old woman and the little old man ran after him as fast as they\\r\\ncould, but he just laughed, and shouted,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy ran on and on, until he came to a cow, by the\\r\\nroadside. \"Stop, little Gingerbread Boy,\" said the cow; \"I want to eat\\r\\nyou.\" The little Gingerbread Boy laughed and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as the cow chased him, he looked over his shoulder and cried,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the cow couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy ran on, and on, and on, till he came to a\\r\\nhorse, in the pasture. \"Please stop, little Gingerbread Boy,\" said the\\r\\nhorse, \"you look very good to eat.\" But the little Gingerbread Boy\\r\\nlaughed out loud. \"Oho! oho!\" he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as the horse chased him, he looked over his shoulder and cried,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the horse couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by the little Gingerbread Boy came to a barn full of threshers.\\r\\nWhen the threshers smelt the Gingerbread Boy, they tried to pick him up,\\r\\nand said, \"Don\\'t run so fast, little Gingerbread Boy; you look very good\\r\\nto eat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little Gingerbread Boy ran harder than ever, and as he ran he\\r\\ncried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he found that he was ahead of the threshers, he turned and\\r\\nshouted back to them,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the threshers couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster than ever. He ran and ran\\r\\nuntil he came to a field full of mowers. When the mowers saw how fine he\\r\\nlooked, they ran after him, calling out, \"Wait a bit! wait a bit, little\\r\\nGingerbread Boy, we wish to eat you!\" But the little Gingerbread Boy\\r\\nlaughed harder than ever, and ran like the wind. \"Oho! oho!\" he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A barn full of threshers,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he found that he was ahead of the mowers, he turned and shouted\\r\\nback to them,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the mowers couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the little Gingerbread Boy was so proud that he didn\\'t\\r\\nthink anybody could catch him. Pretty soon he saw a fox coming across a\\r\\nfield. The fox looked at him and began to run. But the little\\r\\nGingerbread Boy shouted across to him, \"You can\\'t catch me!\" The fox\\r\\nbegan to run faster, and the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster, and as\\r\\nhe ran he chuckled,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A barn full of threshers,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A field full of mowers,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said the fox, \"I would not catch you if I could. I would not\\r\\nthink of disturbing you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, the little Gingerbread Boy came to a river. He could not swim\\r\\nacross, and he wanted to keep running away from the cow and the horse\\r\\nand the people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jump on my tail, and I will take you across,\" said the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little Gingerbread Boy jumped on the fox\\'s tail, and the fox\\r\\nbegan to swim the river. When he was a little way from the bank he\\r\\nturned his head, and said, \"You are too heavy on my tail, little\\r\\nGingerbread Boy, I fear I shall let you get wet; jump on my back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his back.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little farther out, the fox said, \"I am afraid the water will cover\\r\\nyou, there; jump on my shoulder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the stream the fox said, \"Oh, dear! little Gingerbread\\r\\nBoy, my shoulder is sinking; jump on my nose, and I can hold you out of\\r\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minute the fox reached the bank he threw back his head, and gave a\\r\\nsnap!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" said the little Gingerbread Boy, \"I am a quarter gone!\" The\\r\\nnext minute he said, \"Why, I am half gone!\" The next minute he said, \"My\\r\\ngoodness gracious, I am three quarters gone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after that, the little Gingerbread Boy never said anything more at\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE JACKALS AND THE LION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a great big jungle; and in the jungle there was a great\\r\\nbig Lion; and the Lion was king of the jungle. Whenever he wanted\\r\\nanything to eat, all he had to do was to come up out of his cave in the\\r\\nstones and earth and _roar_. When he had roared a few times all the\\r\\nlittle people of the jungle were so frightened that they came out of\\r\\ntheir holes and hiding-places and ran, this way and that, to get away.\\r\\nThen, of course, the Lion could see where they were. And he pounced on\\r\\nthem, killed them, and gobbled them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did this so often that at last there was not a single thing left\\r\\nalive in the jungle besides the Lion, except two little Jackals,--a\\r\\nlittle father Jackal and a little mother Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had run away so many times that they were quite thin and very\\r\\ntired, and they could not run so fast any more. And one day the Lion was\\r\\nso near that the little mother Jackal grew frightened; she said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Father Jackal, Father Jackal! I b\\'lieve our time has come! the Lion\\r\\nwill surely catch us this time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh! nonsense, mother!\" said the little father Jackal. \"Come, we\\'ll\\r\\nrun on a bit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they ran, ran, ran very fast, and the Lion did not catch them that\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last a day came when the Lion was nearer still and the little\\r\\nmother Jackal was frightened almost to death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Father Jackal, Father Jackal!\" she cried; \"I\\'m sure our time has\\r\\ncome! The Lion\\'s going to eat us this time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, mother, don\\'t you fret,\" said the little father Jackal; \"you do\\r\\njust as I tell you, and it will be all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen what did those cunning little Jackals do but take hold of hands and\\r\\nrun up towards the Lion, as if they had meant to come all the time. When\\r\\nhe saw them coming he stood up, and roared in a terrible voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You miserable little wretches, come here and be eaten, at once! Why\\r\\ndidn\\'t you come before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father Jackal bowed very low.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Father Lion,\" he said, \"we meant to come before; we knew we\\r\\nought to come before; and we wanted to come before; but every time we\\r\\nstarted to come, a dreadful great lion came out of the woods and roared\\r\\nat us, and frightened us so that we ran away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" roared the Lion. \"There\\'s no other lion in this\\r\\njungle, and you know it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, indeed, Father Lion,\" said the little Jackal, \"I know that is\\r\\nwhat everybody thinks; but indeed and indeed there is another lion! And\\r\\nhe is as much bigger than you as you are bigger than I! His face is much\\r\\nmore terrible, and his roar far, far more dreadful. Oh, he is far more\\r\\nfearful than you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that the Lion stood up and roared so that the jungle shook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take me to this Lion,\" he said; \"I\\'ll eat him up and then I\\'ll eat you\\r\\nup.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackals danced on ahead, and the Lion stalked behind. They\\r\\nled him to a place where there was a round, deep well of clear water.\\r\\nThey went round on one side of it, and the Lion stalked up to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He lives down there, Father Lion!\" said the little Jackal. \"He lives\\r\\ndown there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion came close and looked down into the water,--and a lion\\'s face\\r\\nlooked back at him out of the water!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he saw that, the Lion roared and shook his mane and showed his\\r\\nteeth. And the lion in the water shook his mane and showed his teeth.\\r\\nThe Lion above shook his mane again and growled again, and made a\\r\\nterrible face. But the lion in the water made just as terrible a one,\\r\\nback. The Lion above couldn\\'t stand that. He leaped down into the well\\r\\nafter the other lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, of course, as you know very well, there wasn\\'t any other lion! It\\r\\nwas only the reflection in the water!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the poor old Lion floundered about and floundered about, and as he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t get up the steep sides of the well, he was at last drowned. And\\r\\nwhen he was drowned, the little Jackals took hold of hands and danced\\r\\nround the well, and sang,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lion is dead! The Lion is dead!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have killed the great Lion who would have killed us!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lion is dead! The Lion is dead!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ao! Ao! Ao!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COUNTRY MOUSE AND THE CITY MOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little mouse\\r\\nfrom the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to\\r\\ndinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to\\r\\neat except barley and grain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" he said, \"you do not live well at all; you should see how I\\r\\nlive! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to\\r\\nvisit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went\\r\\nto the city to visit his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see\\r\\nwas the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the\\r\\nlowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown\\r\\nsugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his\\r\\nfriend to nibble for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought\\r\\nhe had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just\\r\\nthinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened\\r\\nwith a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run!\" whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to\\r\\nthe little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was\\r\\nshaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse\\r\\nsaid, \"That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back,\\r\\nand this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the\\r\\nlittle Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of\\r\\ndried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large\\r\\ndried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it.\\r\\nThis was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse\\r\\nliked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all\\r\\nat once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the\\r\\ndoor and a sharp, loud _miaouw_!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered,\\r\\n\"Sh!\" and ran as fast as he could to the hole. The Country Mouse ran\\r\\nafter, you may be sure, as fast as _he_ could. As soon as they were out\\r\\nof danger the City Mouse said, \"That was the old Cat; she is the best\\r\\nmouser in town,--if she once gets you, you are lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very terrible,\" said the little Country Mouse; \"let us not go\\r\\nback to the cupboard again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the City Mouse, \"I will take you to the cellar; there is\\r\\nsomething specially fine there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into\\r\\na big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars\\r\\nof butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of\\r\\nsausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It\\r\\nsmelt so good that it went to the little Country Mouse\\'s head. He ran\\r\\nalong the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there,\\r\\nuntil he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese\\r\\non a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting\\r\\nhis teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried the City Mouse. \"That is a trap!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Country Mouse stopped and said, \"What is a trap?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That thing is a trap,\" said the little City Mouse. \"The minute you\\r\\ntouch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head\\r\\nhard, and you\\'re dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the\\r\\ncheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. \"If you\\'ll excuse me,\"\\r\\nhe said, \"I think I will go home. I\\'d rather have barley and grain to\\r\\neat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried\\r\\nprunes and cheese,--and be frightened to death all the time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed\\r\\nall the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE JACK ROLLAROUND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a wee little boy who slept in a tiny\\r\\ntrundle-bed near his mother\\'s great bed. The trundle-bed had castors on\\r\\nit so that it could be rolled about, and there was nothing in the world\\r\\nthe little boy liked so much as to have it rolled. When his mother came\\r\\nto bed he would cry, \"Roll me around! roll me around!\" And his mother\\r\\nwould put out her hand from the big bed and push the little bed back and\\r\\nforth till she was tired. The little boy could never get enough; so for\\r\\nthis he was called \"Little Jack Rollaround.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night he had made his mother roll him about, till she fell asleep,\\r\\nand even then he kept crying, \"Roll me around! roll me around!\" His\\r\\nmother pushed him about in her sleep, until her slumber became too\\r\\nsound; then she stopped. But Little Jack Rollaround kept on crying,\\r\\n\"Roll around! roll around!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by the Moon peeped in at the window. He saw a funny sight: Little\\r\\nJack Rollaround was lying in his trundle-bed, and he had put up one\\r\\nlittle fat leg for a mast, and fastened the corner of his wee shirt to\\r\\nit for a sail; and he was blowing at it with all his might, and saying,\\r\\n\"Roll around! roll around!\" Slowly, slowly, the little trundle-bed boat\\r\\nbegan to move; it sailed along the floor and up the wall and across the\\r\\nceiling and down again!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More! more!\" cried Little Jack Rollaround; and the little boat sailed\\r\\nfaster up the wall, across the ceiling, down the wall, and over the\\r\\nfloor. The Moon laughed at the sight; but when Little Jack Rollaround\\r\\nsaw the Moon, he called out, \"Open the door, old Moon! I want to roll\\r\\nthrough the town, so that the people can see me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Moon could not open the door, but he shone in through the keyhole,\\r\\nin a broad band. And Little Jack Rollaround sailed his trundle-bed boat\\r\\nup the beam, through the keyhole, and into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a light, old Moon,\" he said; \"I want the people to see me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the good Moon made a light and went along with him, and the little\\r\\ntrundle-bed boat went sailing down the streets into the main street of\\r\\nthe village. They rolled past the town hall and the schoolhouse and the\\r\\nchurch; but nobody saw little Jack Rollaround, because everybody was in\\r\\nbed, asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t the people come to see me?\" he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh up on the church steeple, the Weather-vane answered, \"It is no time\\r\\nfor people to be in the streets; decent folk are in their beds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll go to the woods, so that the animals may see me,\" said Little\\r\\nJack. \"Come along, old Moon, and make a light!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good Moon went along and made a light, and they came to the forest.\\r\\n\"Roll! roll!\" cried the little boy; and the trundle-bed went trundling\\r\\namong the trees in the great wood, scaring up the squirrels and\\r\\nstartling the little leaves on the trees. The poor old Moon began to\\r\\nhave a bad time of it, for the tree-trunks got in his way so that he\\r\\ncould not go so fast as the bed, and every time he got behind, the\\r\\nlittle boy called, \"Hurry up, old Moon, I want the beasts to see me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all the animals were asleep, and nobody at all looked at Little Jack\\r\\nRollaround except an old White Owl; and all she said was, \"Who are\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy did not like her, so he blew harder, and the trundle-bed\\r\\nboat went sailing through the forest till it came to the end of the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go home now; it is late,\" said the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go with you; make a path!\" said Little Jack Rollaround.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind Moon made a path up to the sky, and up sailed the little bed\\r\\ninto the midst of the sky. All the little bright Stars were there with\\r\\ntheir nice little lamps. And when he saw them, that naughty Little Jack\\r\\nRollaround began to tease. \"Out of the way, there! I am coming!\" he\\r\\nshouted, and sailed the trundle-bed boat straight at them. He bumped the\\r\\nlittle Stars right and left, all over the sky, until every one of them\\r\\nput his little lamp out and left it dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not treat the little Stars so,\" said the good Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jack Rollaround only behaved the worse: \"Get out of the way, old\\r\\nMoon!\" he shouted, \"I am coming!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he steered the little trundle-bed boat straight into the old Moon\\'s\\r\\nface, and bumped his nose!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was too much for the good Moon; he put out his big light, all at\\r\\nonce, and left the sky pitch-black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a light, old Moon! Make a light!\" shouted the little boy. But the\\r\\nMoon answered never a word, and Jack Rollaround could not see where to\\r\\nsteer. He went rolling criss-cross, up and down, all over the sky,\\r\\nknocking into the planets and stumbling into the clouds, till he did not\\r\\nknow where he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he saw a big yellow light at the very edge of the sky. He\\r\\nthought it was the Moon. \"Look out, I am coming!\" he cried, and steered\\r\\nfor the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not the kind old Moon at all; it was the great mother Sun,\\r\\njust coming up out of her home in the sea, to begin her day\\'s work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aha, youngster, what are you doing in my sky?\" she said. And she picked\\r\\nLittle Jack Rollaround up and threw him, trundle-bed boat and all, into\\r\\nthe middle of the sea!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I suppose he is there yet, unless somebody picked him out again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW BROTHER RABBIT FOOLED THE WHALE AND THE ELEPHANT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day little Brother Rabbit was running along on the sand, lippety,\\r\\nlippety, when he saw the Whale and the Elephant talking together.\\r\\nLittle Brother Rabbit crouched down and listened to what they were\\r\\nsaying. This was what they were saying:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are the biggest thing on the land, Brother Elephant,\" said the\\r\\nWhale, \"and I am the biggest thing in the sea; if we join together we\\r\\ncan rule all the animals in the world, and have our way about\\r\\neverything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, very good,\" trumpeted the Elephant; \"that suits me; we will\\r\\ndo it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Brother Rabbit sniggered to himself. \"They won\\'t rule me,\" he\\r\\nsaid. He ran away and got a very long, very strong rope, and he got his\\r\\nbig drum, and hid the drum a long way off in the bushes. Then he went\\r\\nalong the beach till he came to the Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, dear, strong Mr Whale,\" he said, \"will you have the great\\r\\nkindness to do me a favour? My cow is stuck in the mud, a quarter of a\\r\\nmile from here. And I can\\'t pull her out. But you are so strong and so\\r\\nobliging, that I venture to trust you will help me out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whale was so pleased with the compliment that he said, \"Yes,\" at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said the Rabbit, \"I will tie this end of my long rope to you,\\r\\nand I will run away and tie the other end round my cow, and when I am\\r\\nready I will beat my big drum. When you hear that, pull very, very\\r\\nhard, for the cow is stuck very deep in the mud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huh!\" grunted the Whale, \"I\\'ll pull her out, if she is stuck to the\\r\\nhorns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Brother Rabbit tied the rope-end to the Whale, and ran off,\\r\\nlippety, lippety, till he came to the place where the Elephant was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, mighty and kindly Elephant,\" he said, making a very low\\r\\nbow, \"will you do me a favour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" asked the Elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My cow is stuck in the mud, about a quarter of a mile from here,\" said\\r\\nlittle Brother Rabbit, \"and I cannot pull her out. Of course you could.\\r\\nIf you will be so very obliging as to help me----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said the Elephant grandly, \"certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said little Brother Rabbit, \"I will tie one end of this long\\r\\nrope to your trunk, and the other to my cow, and as soon as I have tied\\r\\nher tightly I will beat my big drum. When you hear that, pull; pull as\\r\\nhard as you can, for my cow is very heavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never fear,\" said the Elephant, \"I could pull twenty cows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure you could,\" said the Rabbit, politely, \"only be sure to begin\\r\\ngently, and pull harder and harder till you get her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he tied the end of the rope tightly round the Elephant\\'s trunk,\\r\\nand ran away into the bushes. There he sat down and beat the big drum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whale began to pull, and the Elephant began to pull, and in a jiffy\\r\\nthe rope tightened till it was stretched as hard as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a remarkably heavy cow,\" said the Elephant; \"but I\\'ll fetch\\r\\nher!\" And he braced his forefeet in the earth, and gave a tremendous\\r\\npull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" said the Whale. \"That cow must be stuck mighty tight\"; and he\\r\\ndrove his tail deep in the water, and gave a marvellous pull.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled harder; the Elephant pulled harder. Pretty soon the Whale\\r\\nfound himself sliding toward the land. The reason was, of course, that\\r\\nthe Elephant had something solid to brace against, and, beside, as fast\\r\\nas he pulled the rope in a little, he took a turn with it round his\\r\\ntrunk!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the Whale found himself sliding toward the land he was so\\r\\nprovoked with the cow that he dived head first, down to the bottom of\\r\\nthe sea. That was a pull! The Elephant was jerked off his feet, and came\\r\\nslipping and sliding to the beach, and into the surf. He was terribly\\r\\nangry. He braced himself with all his might, and pulled his best. At the\\r\\njerk, up came the Whale out of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is pulling me?\" spouted the Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is pulling me?\" trumpeted the Elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then each saw the rope in the other\\'s hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll teach you to play cow!\" roared the Elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll show you how to fool me!\" fumed the Whale. And they began to pull\\r\\nagain. But this time the rope broke, the Whale turned a somersault, and\\r\\nthe Elephant fell over backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that, they were both so ashamed that neither would speak to the\\r\\nother. So that broke up the bargain between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd little Brother Rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed, and laughed,\\r\\nand laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE HALF-CHICK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a Spanish Hen, who hatched out some nice\\r\\nlittle chickens. She was much pleased with their looks as they came from\\r\\nthe shell. One, two, three, came out plump and fluffy; but when the\\r\\nfourth shell broke, out came a little half-chick! It had only one leg\\r\\nand one wing and one eye! It was just half a chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hen-mother did not know what in the world to do with the queer\\r\\nlittle Half-Chick. She was afraid something would happen to it, and she\\r\\ntried hard to protect it and keep it from harm. But as soon as it could\\r\\nwalk the little Half-Chick showed a most headstrong spirit, worse than\\r\\nany of its brothers. It would not mind, and it would go wherever it\\r\\nwanted to; it walked with a funny little hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, and\\r\\ngot along pretty fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day the little Half-Chick said, \"Mother, I am off to Madrid, to see\\r\\nthe King! Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor Hen-mother did everything she could think of to keep him from\\r\\ndoing so foolish a thing, but the little Half-Chick laughed at her\\r\\nnaughtily. \"I\\'m for seeing the King,\" he said; \"this life is too quiet\\r\\nfor me.\" And away he went, hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, over the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had gone some distance the little Half-Chick came to a little\\r\\nbrook that was caught in the weeds and in much trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Half-Chick,\" whispered the Water, \"I am so choked with these\\r\\nweeds that I cannot move; I am almost lost, for want of room; please\\r\\npush the sticks and weeds away with your bill and help me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea!\" said the little Half-Chick. \"I cannot be bothered with you;\\r\\nI am off to Madrid, to see the King!\" And in spite of the brook\\'s\\r\\nbegging, he went away, hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bit farther on, the Half-Chick came to a Fire, which was smothered in\\r\\ndamp sticks and in great distress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, little Half-Chick,\" said the Fire, \"you are just in time to save\\r\\nme. I am almost dead for want of air. Fan me a little with your wing, I\\r\\nbeg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea!\" said the little Half-Chick. \"I cannot be bothered with you;\\r\\nI am off to Madrid, to see the King!\" And he went laughing off,\\r\\nhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had hoppity-kicked a good way, and was near Madrid, he came to a\\r\\nclump of bushes, where the Wind was caught fast. The Wind was\\r\\nwhimpering, and begging to be set free.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Half-Chick,\" said the Wind, \"you are just in time to help me; if\\r\\nyou will brush aside these twigs and leaves, I can get my breath; help\\r\\nme, quickly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho! the idea!\" said the little Half-Chick \"I have no time to bother\\r\\nwith you. I am going to Madrid, to see the King.\" And he went off,\\r\\nhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, leaving the Wind to smother.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while he came to Madrid and to the palace of the King.\\r\\nHoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, the little Half-Chick skipped past the\\r\\nsentry at the gate, and hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, he crossed the\\r\\ncourt. But as he was passing the windows of the kitchen the Cook looked\\r\\nout and saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The very thing for the King\\'s dinner!\" she said. \"I was needing a\\r\\nchicken!\" And she seized the little Half-Chick by his one wing and threw\\r\\nhim into a kettle of water on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Water came over the little Half-Chick\\'s feathers, over his head,\\r\\ninto his eyes. It was terribly uncomfortable. The little Half-Chick\\r\\ncried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Water, don\\'t drown me! Stay down, don\\'t come so high!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" the Water said, \"Little Half-Chick, little Half-Chick, when I was\\r\\nin trouble you would not help me,\" and came higher than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Water grew warm, hot, hotter, frightfully hot; the little\\r\\nHalf-Chick cried out, \"Do not burn so hot, Fire! You are burning me to\\r\\ndeath! Stop!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Fire said, \"Little Half-Chick, little Half-Chick, when I was in\\r\\ntrouble you would not help me,\" and burned hotter than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the little Half-Chick thought he must suffocate, the Cook took\\r\\nthe cover off, to look at the dinner. \"Dear me,\" she said, \"this chicken\\r\\nis no good; it is burned to a cinder.\" And she picked the little\\r\\nHalf-Chick up by one leg and threw him out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the air he was caught by a breeze and taken up higher than the trees.\\r\\nRound and round he was twirled till he was so dizzy he thought he must\\r\\nperish. \"Don\\'t blow me so, Wind,\" he cried, \"let me down!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Half-Chick, little Half-Chick,\" said the Wind, \"when I was in\\r\\ntrouble you would not help me!\" And the Wind blew him straight up to the\\r\\ntop of the church steeple, and stuck him there, fast!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he stands to this day, with his one eye, his one wing, and his one\\r\\nleg. He cannot hoppity-kick any more, but he turns slowly round when the\\r\\nwind blows, and keeps his head toward it, to hear what it says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLACKBERRY-BUSH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA little boy sat at his mother\\'s knees, by the long western window,\\r\\nlooking out into the garden. It was autumn, and the wind was sad; and\\r\\nthe golden elm leaves lay scattered about among the grass, and on the\\r\\ngravel path. The mother was knitting a little stocking; her fingers\\r\\nmoved the bright needles; but her eyes were fixed on the clear evening\\r\\nsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the darkness gathered, the wee boy laid his head on her lap and kept\\r\\nso still that, at last, she leaned forward to look into his dear round\\r\\nface. He was not asleep, but was watching very earnestly a\\r\\nblackberry-bush, that waved its one tall, dark-red spray in the wind\\r\\noutside the fence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking about, my darling?\" she said, smoothing his soft,\\r\\nhoney-coloured hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The blackberry-bush, mamma; what does it say? It keeps nodding, nodding\\r\\nto me behind the fence; what does it say, mamma?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It says,\" she answered, \"\\'I see a happy little boy in the warm,\\r\\nfire-lighted room. The wind blows cold, and here it is dark and lonely;\\r\\nbut that little boy is warm and happy and safe at his mother\\'s knees. I\\r\\nnod to him, and he looks at me. I wonder if he knows how happy he is!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'See, all my leaves are dark crimson. Every day they dry and wither\\r\\nmore and more; by and by they will be so weak they can scarcely cling to\\r\\nmy branches, and the north wind will tear them all away, and nobody will\\r\\nremember them any more. Then the snow will sink down and wrap me close.\\r\\nThen the snow will melt again and icy rain will clothe me, and the\\r\\nbitter wind will rattle my bare twigs up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I nod my head to all who pass, and dreary nights and dreary days go\\r\\nby; but in the happy house, so warm and bright, the little boy plays all\\r\\nday with books and toys. His mother and his father cherish him; he\\r\\nnestles on their knees in the red firelight at night, while they read to\\r\\nhim lovely stories, or sing sweet old songs to him,--the happy little\\r\\nboy! And outside I peep over the snow and see a stream of ruddy light\\r\\nfrom a crack in the window-shutter, and I nod out here alone in the\\r\\ndark, thinking how beautiful it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And here I wait patiently. I take the snow and the rain and the cold,\\r\\nand I am not sorry, but glad; for in my roots I feel warmth and life,\\r\\nand I know that a store of greenness and beauty is shut up safe in my\\r\\nsmall brown buds. Day and night go again and again; little by little the\\r\\nsnow melts all away; the ground grows soft; the sky is blue; the little\\r\\nbirds fly over, crying, \"It is spring! it is spring!\" Ah! then through\\r\\nall my twigs I feel the slow sap stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Warmer grow the sunbeams, and softer the air. The small blades of\\r\\ngrass creep thick about my feet; the sweet rain helps to swell my\\r\\nshining buds. More and more I push forth my leaves, till out I burst in\\r\\na gay green dress, and nod in joy and pride. The little boy comes\\r\\nrunning to look at me, and cries, \"Oh, mamma! the little blackberry-bush\\r\\nis alive and beautiful and green. Oh, come and see!\" And I hear; and I\\r\\nbow my head in the summer wind; and every day they watch me grow more\\r\\nbeautiful, till at last I shake out blossoms, fair and fragrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'A few days more, and I drop the white petals down among the grass,\\r\\nand, lo! there are the green tiny berries! Carefully I hold them up to\\r\\nthe sun; carefully I gather the dew in the summer nights; slowly they\\r\\nripen; they grow larger and redder and darker, and at last they are\\r\\nblack, shining, delicious. I hold them as high as I can for the little\\r\\nboy, who comes dancing out. He shouts with joy, and gathers them in his\\r\\ndear hand; and he runs to share them with his mother, saying, \"Here is\\r\\nwhat the patient blackberry-bush bore for us: see how nice, mamma!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ah! then indeed I am glad, and would say, if I could, \"Yes, take them,\\r\\ndear little boy; I kept them for you, held them long up to the sun and\\r\\nrain to make them sweet and ripe for you\"; and I nod and nod in full\\r\\ncontent, for my work is done. From the window he watches me and thinks,\\r\\n\"There is the little blackberry-bush that was so kind to me. I see it\\r\\nand I love it. I know it is safe out there nodding all alone, and next\\r\\nsummer it will hold ripe berries up for me to gather again.\"\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wee boy smiled, and said he liked the little story. His mother\\r\\ntook him up in her arms, and they went out to supper and left the\\r\\nblackberry-bush nodding up and down in the wind; and there it is\\r\\nnodding yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FAIRIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Up the airy mountain,\\r\\n       Down the rushy glen,\\r\\n     We daren\\'t go a-hunting\\r\\n       For fear of little men.\\r\\n     Wee folk, good folk,\\r\\n       Trooping all together;\\r\\n     Green jacket, red cap,\\r\\n       And white owl\\'s feather!\\r\\n\\r\\n     Down along the rocky shore\\r\\n       Some make their home--\\r\\n     They live on crispy pancakes\\r\\n       Of yellow tide-foam;\\r\\n     Some in the reeds\\r\\n       Of the black mountain-lake,\\r\\n     With frogs for their watch-dogs,\\r\\n       All night awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     High on the hilltop\\r\\n       The old King sits;\\r\\n     He is now so old and gray,\\r\\n       He\\'s nigh lost his wits.\\r\\n     With a bridge of white mist\\r\\n       Columbkill he crosses,\\r\\n     On his stately journeys\\r\\n       From Slieveleague to Rosses;\\r\\n     Or going up with music\\r\\n       On cold starry nights,\\r\\n     To sup with the Queen\\r\\n       Of the gay Northern Lights.\\r\\n\\r\\n     They stole little Bridget\\r\\n       For seven years long;\\r\\n     When she came down again\\r\\n       Her friends were all gone.\\r\\n     They took her lightly back,\\r\\n       Between the night and morrow;\\r\\n     They thought that she was fast asleep,\\r\\n       But she was dead with sorrow.\\r\\n     They have kept her ever since\\r\\n       Deep within the lake,\\r\\n     On a bed of flag-leaves,\\r\\n       Watching till she wake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     By the craggy hillside,\\r\\n       Through the mosses bare,\\r\\n     They have planted thorn-trees,\\r\\n       For pleasure here and there.\\r\\n     Is any man so daring\\r\\n       As dig them up in spite,\\r\\n     He shall find their sharpest thorns\\r\\n       In his bed at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Up the airy mountain,\\r\\n       Down the rushy glen,\\r\\n     We daren\\'t go a-hunting\\r\\n       For fear of little men.\\r\\n     Wee folk, good folk,\\r\\n       Trooping all together;\\r\\n     Green jacket, red cap,\\r\\n       And white owl\\'s feather!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF THE LITTLE FIELD MOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, there was a little brown Field Mouse; and one day he\\r\\nwas out in the fields to see what he could find. He was running along in\\r\\nthe grass, poking his nose into everything and looking with his two eyes\\r\\nall about, when he saw a smooth, shiny acorn, lying in the grass. It was\\r\\nsuch a fine shiny little acorn that he thought he would take it home\\r\\nwith him; so he put out his paw to touch it, but the little acorn rolled\\r\\naway from him. He ran after it, but it kept rolling on, just ahead of\\r\\nhim, till it came to a place where a big oak-tree had its roots spread\\r\\nall over the ground. Then it rolled under a big round root.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Mr Field Mouse ran to the root and poked his nose under after the\\r\\nacorn, and there he saw a small round hole in the ground. He slipped\\r\\nthrough and saw some stairs going down into the earth. The acorn was\\r\\nrolling down, with a soft tapping sound, ahead of him, so down he went\\r\\ntoo. Down, down, down, rolled the acorn, and down, down, down, went the\\r\\nField Mouse, until suddenly he saw a tiny door at the foot of the\\r\\nstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shiny acorn rolled to the door and struck against it with a tap.\\r\\nQuickly the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside. The Field\\r\\nMouse hurried as fast as he could down the last stairs, and pushed\\r\\nthrough just as the door was closing. It shut behind him, and he was in\\r\\na little room. And there, before him, stood a queer little Red Man! He\\r\\nhad a little red cap, and a little red jacket, and odd little red shoes\\r\\nwith points at the toes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are my prisoner,\" he said to the Field Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What for?\" said the Field Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you tried to steal my acorn,\" said the little Red Man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is my acorn,\" said the Field Mouse; \"I found it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said the little Red Man, \"I have it; you will never see\\r\\nit again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Field Mouse looked all about the room as fast as he could,\\r\\nbut he could not see any acorn. Then he thought he would go back up the\\r\\ntiny stairs to his own home. But the little door was locked, and the\\r\\nlittle Red Man had the key. And he said to the poor mouse,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall be my servant; you shall make my bed and sweep my room and\\r\\ncook my broth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little brown Mouse was the little Red Man\\'s servant, and every\\r\\nday he made the little Red Man\\'s bed and swept the little Red Man\\'s room\\r\\nand cooked the little Red Man\\'s broth. And every day the little Red Man\\r\\nwent away through the tiny door, and did not come back till afternoon.\\r\\nBut he always locked the door after him, and carried away the key.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before\\r\\nthe door was quite latched, which, of course, didn\\'t lock it at all. He\\r\\nwent away without noticing,--he was in such a hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Field Mouse knew that his chance had come to run away home.\\r\\nBut he didn\\'t want to go without the pretty, shiny acorn. Where it was\\r\\nhe didn\\'t know, so he looked everywhere. He opened every little drawer\\r\\nand looked in, but it wasn\\'t in any of the drawers; he peeped on every\\r\\nshelf, but it wasn\\'t on a shelf; he hunted in every closet, but it\\r\\nwasn\\'t in there. Finally, he climbed up on a chair and opened a wee, wee\\r\\ndoor in the chimney-piece,--and there it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took it quickly in his forepaws, and then he took it in his mouth,\\r\\nand then he ran away. He pushed open the little door; he climbed up, up,\\r\\nup the little stairs; he came out through the hole under the root; he\\r\\nran and ran through the fields; and at last he came to his own house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was in his own house he set the shiny acorn on the table. I\\r\\nexpect he set it down hard, for all at once, with a little snap, it\\r\\nopened!--exactly like a little box.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what do you think! There was a tiny necklace inside! It was a most\\r\\nbeautiful tiny necklace, all made of jewels, and it was just big enough\\r\\nfor a lady mouse. So the little Field Mouse gave the tiny necklace to\\r\\nhis little Mouse-sister. She thought it was perfectly lovely. And when\\r\\nshe wasn\\'t wearing it she kept it in the shiny acorn box.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little Red Man never knew what had become of it, because he\\r\\ndidn\\'t know where the little Field Mouse lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANOTHER LITTLE RED HEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little Red Hen, who lived on a farm all by\\r\\nherself. An old Fox, crafty and sly, had a den in the rocks, on a hill\\r\\nnear her house. Many and many a night this old Fox used to lie awake\\r\\nand think to himself how good that little Red Hen would taste if he\\r\\ncould once get her in his big kettle and boil her for dinner. But he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t catch the little Red Hen, because she was too wise for him.\\r\\nEvery time she went out to market she locked the door of the house\\r\\nbehind her, and as soon as she came in again she locked the door behind\\r\\nher and put the key in her apron pocket, where she kept her scissors and\\r\\nsome sugar candy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the old Fox thought out a way to catch the little Red Hen. Early\\r\\nin the morning he said to his old mother, \"Have the kettle boiling when\\r\\nI come home to-night, for I\\'ll be bringing the little Red Hen for\\r\\nsupper.\" Then he took a big bag and slung it over his shoulder, and\\r\\nwalked till he came to the little Red Hen\\'s house. The little Red Hen\\r\\nwas just coming out of her door to pick up a few sticks for firewood. So\\r\\nthe old Fox hid behind the wood-pile, and as soon as she bent down to\\r\\nget a stick, into the house he slipped, and scurried behind the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a minute the little Red Hen came quickly in, and shut the door and\\r\\nlocked it. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m safely in,\" she said. Just as she said it, she\\r\\nturned round, and there stood the ugly old Fox, with his big bag over\\r\\nhis shoulder. Whiff! how scared the little Red Hen was! She dropped her\\r\\napronful of sticks, and flew up to the big beam across the ceiling.\\r\\nThere she perched, and she said to the old Fox, down below, \"You may as\\r\\nwell go home, for you can\\'t get me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t I, though!\" said the Fox. And what do you think he did? He stood\\r\\non the floor underneath the little Red Hen and twirled round in a circle\\r\\nafter his own tail. And as he spun, and spun, and spun, faster, and\\r\\nfaster, and faster, the poor little Red Hen got so dizzy watching him\\r\\nthat she couldn\\'t hold on to the perch. She dropped off, and the old Fox\\r\\npicked her up and put her in his bag, slung the bag over his shoulder,\\r\\nand started for home, where the kettle was boiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a very long way to go, up hill, and the little Red Hen was still\\r\\nso dizzy that she didn\\'t know where she was. But when the dizziness\\r\\nbegan to go off, she whisked her little scissors out of her apron\\r\\npocket, and snip! she cut a little hole in the bag; then she poked her\\r\\nhead out and saw where she was, and as soon as they came to a good spot\\r\\nshe cut the hole bigger and jumped out herself. There was a great big\\r\\nstone lying there, and the little Red Hen picked it up and put it in the\\r\\nbag as quick as a wink. Then she ran as fast as she could till she came\\r\\nto her own little farmhouse, and she went in and locked the door with\\r\\nthe big key.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Fox went on carrying the stone and never knew the difference.\\r\\nMy, but it bumped him well! He was pretty tired when he got home. But he\\r\\nwas so pleased to think of the supper he was going to have that he did\\r\\nnot mind that at all. As soon as his mother opened the door he said, \"Is\\r\\nthe kettle boiling?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said his mother; \"have you got the little Red Hen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have,\" said the old Fox. \"When I open the bag you hold the cover off\\r\\nthe kettle and I\\'ll shake the bag so that the Hen will fall in, and then\\r\\nyou pop the cover on, before she can jump out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said his mean old mother; and she stood close by the\\r\\nboiling kettle, ready to put the cover on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fox lifted the big, heavy bag up till it was over the open kettle,\\r\\nand gave it a shake.

By the time he got home there wasn\\'t anything\\r\\nleft but a fistful of crumbs. His Mammy said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you got there, Epaminondas?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cake, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cake!\" said his Mammy. \"Epaminondas, you ain\\'t got the sense you was\\r\\nborn with! That\\'s no way to carry cake. The way to carry cake is to wrap\\r\\nit all up nice in some leaves and put it in your hat, and put your hat\\r\\non your head, and come along home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day Epaminondas went to see his Auntie, and she gave him a pound of\\r\\nbutter for his Mammy; fine, fresh, sweet butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpaminondas wrapped it up in leaves and put it in his hat, and put his\\r\\nhat on his head, and came along home. It was a very hot day. Pretty soon\\r\\nthe butter began to melt. It melted, and melted, and as it melted it ran\\r\\ndown Epaminondas\\' forehead; then it ran over his face, and in his ears,\\r\\nand down his neck. When he got home, all the butter Epaminondas had was\\r\\n_on him_. His Mammy looked at him, and then she said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Law\\'s sake! Epaminondas, what you got in your hat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Butter, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas; \"Auntie gave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Butter!\" said his Mammy. \"Epaminondas, you ain\\'t got the sense you was\\r\\nborn with! Don\\'t you know that\\'s no way to carry butter? The way to\\r\\ncarry butter is to wrap it up in some leaves and take it down to the\\r\\nbrook, and cool it in the water, and cool it in the water, and cool it\\r\\nin the water, and then take it on your hands, careful, and bring it\\r\\nalong home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, another day, Epaminondas went to see his Auntie again, and;\\r\\nthis time she gave him a little new puppy-dog to take home.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpaminondas put it in some leaves and took it down to the brook; and\\r\\nthere he cooled it in the water, and cooled it in the water, and cooled\\r\\nit in the water; then he took it in his hands and came along home. When\\r\\nhe got home, the puppy-dog was dead. His Mammy looked at it, and she\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Law\\'s sake! Epaminondas, what you got there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A puppy-dog, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A _puppy-dog_!\" said his Mammy. \"My gracious sakes alive, Epaminondas,\\r\\nyou ain\\'t got the sense you was born with! That ain\\'t the way to carry a\\r\\npuppy-dog! The way to carry a puppy-dog is to take a long piece of\\r\\nstring and tie one end of it round the puppy-dog\\'s neck and put the\\r\\npuppy-dog on the ground, and take hold of the other end of the string\\r\\nand come along home, like this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day Epaminondas went to see his Auntie again, and when he came to\\r\\ngo home she gave him a loaf of bread to carry to his Mammy; a brown,\\r\\nfresh, crusty loaf of bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Epaminondas tied a string around the end of the loaf and took hold of\\r\\nthe end of the string and came along home, like this. (Imitate dragging\\r\\nsomething along the ground.) When he got home his Mammy looked at the\\r\\nthing on the end of the string, and she said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My laws a-massy! Epaminondas, what you got on the end of that string?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas; \"Auntie gave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread!!!\" said his Mammy. \"O Epaminondas, Epaminondas, you ain\\'t got\\r\\nthe sense you was born with; you never did have the sense you was born\\r\\nwith; you never will have the sense you was born with! Now I ain\\'t gwine\\r\\ntell you any more ways to bring truck home. And don\\'t you go see your\\r\\nAuntie, neither. I\\'ll go see her my own self. But I\\'ll just tell you one\\r\\nthing, Epaminondas! You see these here six mince pies I done make? You\\r\\nsee how I done set \\'em on the doorstep to cool? Well, now, you hear me,\\r\\nEpaminondas, _you be careful how you step on those pies_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Epaminondas\\' Mammy put on her bonnet and her shawl and took a\\r\\nbasket in her hand and went away to see Auntie. The six mince pies sat\\r\\ncooling in a row on the doorstep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then,--and then,--Epaminondas _was_ careful how he stepped on those\\r\\npies!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped (imitate)--right--in--the--middle--of--every--one.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, do you know, children, nobody knows what happened next! The person\\r\\nwho told me the story didn\\'t know; nobody knows. But you can guess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BOY WHO CRIED \"WOLF!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a shepherd-boy who kept his flock at a little distance\\r\\nfrom the village. Once he thought he would play a trick on the villagers\\r\\nand have some fun at their expense. So he ran toward the village crying\\r\\nout, with all his might,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wolf! Wolf! Come and help! The wolves are at my lambs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind villagers left their work and ran to the field to help him. But\\r\\nwhen they got there the boy laughed at them for their pains; there was\\r\\nno wolf there.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill another day the boy tried the same trick, and the villagers came\\r\\nrunning to help and got laughed at again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen one day a wolf did break into the fold and began killing the lambs.\\r\\nIn great fright, the boy ran for help. \"Wolf! Wolf!\" he screamed. \"There\\r\\nis a wolf in the flock! Help!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe villagers heard him, but they thought it was another mean trick; no\\r\\none paid the least attention, or went near him. And the shepherd-boy\\r\\nlost all his sheep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the kind of thing that happens to people who lie: even when they\\r\\ntell the truth no one believes them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FROG KING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you ever hear the old story about the foolish Frogs? The Frogs in a\\r\\ncertain swamp decided that they needed a king; they had always got along\\r\\nperfectly well without one, but they suddenly made up their minds that a\\r\\nking they must have. They sent a messenger to Jove and begged him to\\r\\nsend a king to rule over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJove saw how stupid they were, and sent a king who could not harm them:\\r\\nhe tossed a big log into the middle of the pond.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the splash the Frogs were terribly frightened, and dived into their\\r\\nholes to hide from King Log. But after a while, when they saw that the\\r\\nking never moved, they got over their fright and went and sat on him.\\r\\nAnd as soon as they found he really could not hurt them they began to\\r\\ndespise him; and finally they sent another messenger to Jove to ask for\\r\\na new king.\\r\\n\\r\\nJove sent an eel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frogs were much pleased and a good deal frightened when King Eel\\r\\ncame wriggling and swimming among them. But as the days went on, and the\\r\\neel was perfectly harmless, they stopped being afraid; and as soon as\\r\\nthey stopped fearing King Eel they stopped respecting him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon they sent a third messenger to Jove, and begged that they might\\r\\nhave a better king,--a king who was worth while.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too much; Jove was angry at their stupidity at last. \"I will give\\r\\nyou a king such as you deserve!\" he said; and he sent them a Stork.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the Frogs came to the surface to greet the new king, King\\r\\nStork caught them in his long bill and gobbled them up. One after\\r\\nanother they came bobbing up, and one after another the stork ate them.\\r\\nHe was indeed a king worthy of them!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SUN AND THE WIND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun and the Wind once had a quarrel as to which was the stronger.\\r\\nEach believed himself to be the more powerful. While they were arguing\\r\\nthey saw a traveller walking along the country highway, wearing a great\\r\\ncloak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a chance to test our strength,\" said the Wind; \"let us see\\r\\nwhich of us is strong enough to make that traveller take off his cloak;\\r\\nthe one who can do that shall be acknowledged the more powerful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Agreed,\" said the Sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the Wind began to blow; he puffed and tugged at the man\\'s\\r\\ncloak, and raised a storm of hail and rain, to beat at it. But the\\r\\ncolder it grew and the more it stormed, the tighter the traveller held\\r\\nhis cloak around him. The Wind could not get it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it was the Sun\\'s turn. He shone with all his beams on the man\\'s\\r\\nshoulders. As it grew hotter and hotter, the man unfastened his cloak;\\r\\nthen he threw it back; at last he took it off! The Sun had won.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE ALLIGATOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal was very fond of shell-fish. He used to go down by the\\r\\nriver and hunt along the edges for crabs and such things. And once, when\\r\\nhe was hunting for crabs, he was so hungry that he put his paw into the\\r\\nwater after a crab without looking first,--which you never should do!\\r\\nThe minute he put in his paw, _snap_!--the big Alligator who lives in\\r\\nthe mud down there had it in his jaws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear!\" thought the little Jackal; \"the big Alligator has my paw in\\r\\nhis mouth! In another minute he will pull me down and gobble me up! What\\r\\nshall I do? what shall I do?\" Then he thought, suddenly, \"I\\'ll deceive\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he put on a very cheerful voice, as if nothing at all were the\\r\\nmatter, and he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho! ho! Clever Mr Alligator! Smart Mr Alligator, to take that old\\r\\nbulrush root for my paw! I hope you\\'ll find it very tender!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator was hidden away beneath the mud and bulrush leaves,\\r\\nand he couldn\\'t see anything. He thought, \"Pshaw! I\\'ve made a mistake.\"\\r\\nSo he opened his mouth and let the little Jackal go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal ran away as fast as he could, and as he ran he called\\r\\nout,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator! Kind Mr Alligator! _So_ kind of you to let me\\r\\ngo!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator lashed with his tail and snapped with his jaws, but it\\r\\nwas too late; the little Jackal was out of reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this the little Jackal kept away from the river, out of danger.\\r\\nBut after about a week he got such an appetite for crabs that nothing\\r\\nelse would do at all; he felt that he must have a crab. So he went down\\r\\nby the river and looked all around, very carefully. He didn\\'t see the\\r\\nold Alligator, but he thought to himself, \"I think I\\'ll not take any\\r\\nchances.\" So he stood still and began to talk out loud to himself. He\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I don\\'t see any little crabs on the land I generally see them\\r\\nsticking out of the water, and then I put my paw in and catch them. I\\r\\nwonder if there are any fat little crabs in the water to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator was hidden down in the mud at the bottom of the river,\\r\\nand when he heard what the little Jackal said, he thought, \"Aha! I\\'ll\\r\\npretend to be a little crab, and when he puts his paw in, I\\'ll make my\\r\\ndinner of him.\" So he stuck the black end of his snout above the water\\r\\nand waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal took one look, and then he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator! Kind Mr Alligator! You are _exceedingly_ kind\\r\\nto show me where you are! I will have dinner elsewhere.\" And he ran away\\r\\nlike the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator foamed at the mouth, he was so angry, but the little\\r\\nJackal was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two whole weeks the little Jackal kept away from the river. Then,\\r\\none day he got a feeling inside him that nothing but crabs could\\r\\nsatisfy: he felt that he must have at least one crab. Very cautiously,\\r\\nhe went down to the river and looked all around. He saw no sign of the\\r\\nold Alligator. Still, he did not mean to take any chances. So he stood\\r\\nquite still and began to talk to himself,--it was a little way he had.\\r\\nHe said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I don\\'t see any little crabs on the shore, or sticking up out of\\r\\nthe water, I usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water; the\\r\\nlittle bubbles go _puff, puff, puff_, and then they go _pop, pop, pop_,\\r\\nand they show me where the little juicy crabs are, so I can put my paw\\r\\nin and catch them. I wonder if I shall see any little bubbles to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator, lying low in the mud and weeds, heard this, and he\\r\\nthought, \"Pooh! _That\\'s_ easy enough; I\\'ll just blow some little\\r\\ncrab-bubbles, and then he will put his paw in where I can get it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he blew, and he blew, a mighty blast, and the bubbles rose in a\\r\\nperfect whirlpool, fizzing and swirling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal didn\\'t have to be told who was underneath those\\r\\nbubbles: he took one quick look, and off he ran. But as he went, he\\r\\nsang,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator! Kind Mr Alligator! You are the kindest\\r\\nAlligator in the world, to show me where you are, so nicely! I\\'ll\\r\\nbreakfast at another part of the river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator was so furious that he crawled up on the bank and went\\r\\nafter the little Jackal; but, dear, dear, he couldn\\'t catch the little\\r\\nJackal; he ran far too fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, the little Jackal did not like to risk going near the water,\\r\\nso he ate no more crabs. But he found a garden of wild figs, which were\\r\\nso good that he went there every day, and ate them instead of\\r\\nshell-fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old Alligator found this out, and he made up his mind to have\\r\\nthe little Jackal for supper, or to die trying. So he crept, and\\r\\ncrawled, and dragged himself over the ground to the garden of wild figs.\\r\\nThere he made a huge pile of figs under the biggest of the wild fig\\r\\ntrees, and hid himself in the pile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while the little Jackal came dancing into the garden, very happy\\r\\nand free from care,--_but_ looking all around. He saw the huge pile of\\r\\nfigs under the big fig tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H-m,\" he thought, \"that looks singularly like my friend, the Alligator.\\r\\nI\\'ll investigate a bit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood quite still and began to talk to himself,--it was a little way\\r\\nhe had. He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little figs I like best are the fat, ripe, juicy ones that drop off\\r\\nwhen the breeze blows; and then the wind blows them about on the ground,\\r\\nthis way and that; the great heap of figs over there is so still that I\\r\\nthink they must be all bad figs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator, underneath his fig pile, thought,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bother the suspicious little Jackal! I shall have to make these figs\\r\\nroll about, so that he will think the wind moves them.\" And straight-way\\r\\nhe humped himself up and moved, and sent the little figs flying,--and\\r\\nhis back showed through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal did not wait for a second look. He ran out of the\\r\\ngarden like the wind. But as he ran he called back,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, again, Mr Alligator; very sweet of you to show me where you\\r\\nare; I can\\'t stay to thank you as I should like: good-bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the old Alligator was beside himself with rage. He vowed that he\\r\\nwould have the little Jackal for supper this time, come what might. So\\r\\nhe crept and crawled over the ground till he came to the little Jackal\\'s\\r\\nhouse. Then he crept and crawled inside, and hid himself there in the\\r\\nhouse, to wait till the little Jackal should come home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by the little Jackal came dancing home, happy and free from\\r\\ncare,--_but_ looking all around. Presently, as he came along, he saw\\r\\nthat the ground was all raked up as if something very heavy had been\\r\\ndragged over it. The little Jackal stopped and looked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this? what\\'s this?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he saw that the door of his house was crushed at the sides and\\r\\nbroken, as if something very big had gone through it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this? What\\'s this?\" the little Jackal said. \"I think I\\'ll\\r\\ninvestigate a little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he stood quite still and began to talk to himself (you remember, it\\r\\nwas a little way he had), but loudly. He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange that my little House doesn\\'t speak to me! Why don\\'t you\\r\\nspeak to me, little House? You always speak to me, if everything is all\\r\\nright, when I come home. I wonder if anything is wrong with my little\\r\\nHouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to\\r\\nbe the little House, or the little Jackal would never come in. So he put\\r\\non as pleasant a voice as he could (which is not saying much) and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hullo, little Jackal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! When the little Jackal heard that, he was frightened enough, for\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the old Alligator,\" he said, \"and if I don\\'t make an end of him\\r\\nthis time he will certainly make an end of me. What shall I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought very fast. Then he spoke out pleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, little House,\" he said, \"it\\'s good to hear your pretty\\r\\nvoice, dear little House, and I will be in with you in a minute; only\\r\\nfirst I must gather some firewood for dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went and gathered firewood, and more firewood, and more\\r\\nfirewood; and he piled it all up solid against the door and round the\\r\\nhouse; and then he set fire to it!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it smoked and burned till it smoked that old Alligator to smoked\\r\\nherring!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LARKS IN THE CORNFIELD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a family of little Larks who lived with their mother in a\\r\\nnest in a cornfield. When the corn was ripe the mother Lark watched very\\r\\ncarefully to see if there were any sign of the reapers\\' coming, for she\\r\\nknew that when they came their sharp knives would cut down the nest and\\r\\nhurt the baby Larks. So every day, when she went out for food, she told\\r\\nthe little Larks to look and listen very closely to everything that\\r\\nwent on, and to tell her all they saw and heard when she came home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day when she came home the little Larks were much frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Mother, dear Mother,\" they said, \"you must move us away to-night!\\r\\nThe farmer was in the field to-day, and he said, \\'The corn is ready to\\r\\ncut; we must call in the neighbours to help.\\' And then he told his son\\r\\nto go out to-night and ask all the neighbours to come and reap the corn\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother Lark laughed. \"Don\\'t be frightened,\" she said; \"if he waits\\r\\nfor his neighbours to reap the corn we shall have plenty of time to\\r\\nmove; tell me what he says to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night the little Larks were quite trembling with fear; the\\r\\nmoment their mother got home they cried out, \"Mother, you must surely\\r\\nmove us to-night! The farmer came to-day and said, \\'The corn is getting\\r\\ntoo ripe; we cannot wait for our neighbours; we must ask our relatives\\r\\nto help us.\\' And then he called his son and told him to ask all the\\r\\nuncles and cousins to come to-morrow and cut the corn. Shall we not move\\r\\nto-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" said the mother Lark; \"the uncles and cousins have plenty\\r\\nof reaping to do for themselves; we\\'ll not move yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third night, when the mother Lark came home, the baby Larks said,\\r\\n\"Mother, dear, the farmer came to the field to-day, and when he looked\\r\\nat the corn he was quite angry; he said, \\'This will never do! The corn\\r\\nis getting too ripe; it\\'s no use to wait for our relatives, we shall\\r\\nhave to cut this corn ourselves.\\' And then he called his son and said,\\r\\n\\'Go out to-night and hire reapers, and to-morrow we will begin to cut.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the mother, \"that is another story; when a man begins to do\\r\\nhis own business, instead of asking somebody else to do it, things get\\r\\ndone. I will move you out to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA TRUE STORY ABOUT A GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there were four little girls who lived in a big, bare house, in the\\r\\ncountry. They were very poor, but they had the happiest times you ever\\r\\nheard of, because they were very rich in everything except money. They\\r\\nhad a wonderful, wise father, who knew stories to tell, and who taught\\r\\nthem their lessons in such a beautiful way that it was better than play;\\r\\nthey had a lovely, merry, kind mother, who was never too tired to help\\r\\nthem work or watch them play; and they had all the great green country\\r\\nto play in. There were dark, shadowy woods, and fields of flowers, and a\\r\\nriver. And there was a big barn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the little girls was named Louisa. She was very pretty, and ever\\r\\nso strong; she could run for miles through the woods and not get tired.\\r\\nShe had a splendid brain in her little head; it liked study, and it\\r\\nthought interesting thoughts all day long.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa liked to sit in a corner by herself, sometimes, and write\\r\\nthoughts in her diary; all the little girls kept diaries. She liked to\\r\\nmake up stories out of her own head, and sometimes she made verses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the four little sisters had finished their lessons, and had helped\\r\\ntheir mother wash up and sew, they used to go to the big barn to play;\\r\\nand the best play of all was theatricals. Louisa liked theatricals\\r\\nbetter than anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey made the barn into a theatre, and the grown-up people came to see\\r\\nthe plays they acted. They used to climb up on the hay-loft for a stage,\\r\\nand the grown people sat in chairs on the floor. It was great fun. One\\r\\nof the plays they acted was _Jack and the Beanstalk_. They had a ladder\\r\\nfrom the floor to the loft, and on the ladder they tied a vine all the\\r\\nway up to the loft, to look like the wonderful beanstalk. One of the\\r\\nlittle girls was dressed up to look like Jack, and she acted that part.\\r\\nWhen it came to the place in the story where the giant tried to follow\\r\\nJack, the little girl cut down the beanstalk, and down came the giant\\r\\ntumbling from the loft. The giant was made out of pillows, with a great,\\r\\nfierce head of paper, and funny clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother story that they acted was _Cinderella_. They made a wonderful\\r\\nbig pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow, trimmed with yellow paper, and\\r\\nCinderella rolled away in it, when the fairy godmother waved her wand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other beautiful story they used to play. It was the story of\\r\\n_Pilgrim\\'s Progress_; if you have never heard it, you must be sure to\\r\\nread it as soon as you can read well enough to understand the\\r\\nold-fashioned words. The little girls used to put shells in their hats\\r\\nfor a sign they were on a pilgrimage, as the old pilgrims used to do;\\r\\nthen they made journeys over the hill behind the house, and through the\\r\\nwoods, and down the lanes; and when the pilgrimage was over they had\\r\\napples and nuts to eat, in the happy land of home.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa loved all these plays, and she made some of her own and wrote\\r\\nthem down so that the children could act them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut better than fun or writing Louisa loved her mother, and by and by,\\r\\nas the little girl began to grow into a big girl, she felt very sad to\\r\\nsee her dear mother work so hard. She helped all she could with the\\r\\nhousework, but nothing could really help the tired mother except money;\\r\\nshe needed money for food and clothes, and someone grown up, to help in\\r\\nthe house. But there never was enough money for these things, and\\r\\nLouisa\\'s mother grew more and more weary, and sometimes ill. I cannot\\r\\ntell you how much Louisa suffered over this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, as Louisa thought about it, she came to care more about helping\\r\\nher mother and her father and her sisters than about anything else in\\r\\nall the world. And she began to work very hard to earn money. She sewed\\r\\nfor people, and when she was a little older she taught some little girls\\r\\ntheir lessons, and then she wrote stories for the papers. Every bit of\\r\\nmoney she earned, except what she had to use, she gave to her dear\\r\\nfamily. It helped very much, but it was so little that Louisa never felt\\r\\nas if she were doing anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery year she grew more unselfish, and every year she worked harder.\\r\\nShe liked writing stories best of all her work, but she did not get much\\r\\nmoney for them, and some people told her she was wasting her time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, a publisher asked Louisa, who was now a woman, to\\r\\nwrite a book for girls. Louisa was not very well, and she was very\\r\\ntired, but she always said, \"I\\'ll try,\" when she had a chance to work;\\r\\nso she said, \"I\\'ll try,\" to the publisher. When she thought about the\\r\\nbook she remembered the good times she used to have with her sisters in\\r\\nthe big, bare house in the country. And so she wrote a story and put all\\r\\nthat in it; she put her dear mother and her wise father in it, and all\\r\\nthe little sisters, and besides the jolly times and the plays, she put\\r\\nthe sad, hard times in,--the work and worry and going without things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the book was written, she called it _Little Women_, and sent it to\\r\\nthe publisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, children, the little book made Louisa famous. It was so sweet and\\r\\nfunny and sad and real,--like our own lives,--that everybody wanted to\\r\\nread it. Everybody bought it, and much money came from it. After so many\\r\\nyears, little Louisa\\'s wish came true: she bought a nice house for her\\r\\nfamily; she sent one of her sisters to Europe, to study; she gave her\\r\\nfather books; but best of all, she was able to see to it that the\\r\\nbeloved mother, so tired and so ill, could have rest and happiness.\\r\\nNever again did the dear mother have to do any hard work, and she had\\r\\npretty things about her all the rest of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa Alcott, for that was Louisa\\'s name, wrote many beautiful books\\r\\nafter this, and she became one of the most famous women of America. But\\r\\nI think the most beautiful thing about her is what I have been telling\\r\\nyou: that she loved her mother so well that she gave her whole life to\\r\\nmake her happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY KINGDOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Louisa I told you about, who wrote verses and stories in her\\r\\ndiary, used to like to play that she was a princess, and that her\\r\\nkingdom was her own mind. When she had unkind or dissatisfied thoughts,\\r\\nshe tried to get rid of them by playing they were enemies of the\\r\\nkingdom; and she drove them out with soldiers; the soldiers were\\r\\npatience, duty, and love. It used to help Louisa to be good to play\\r\\nthis, and I think it may have helped make her the splendid woman she was\\r\\nafterward. Maybe you would like to hear a poem she wrote about it, when\\r\\nshe was only fourteen years old. It will help you, too, to think the\\r\\nsame thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n     A little kingdom I possess,\\r\\n       Where thoughts and feelings dwell,\\r\\n     And very hard I find the task\\r\\n       Of governing it well;\\r\\n     For passion tempts and troubles me,\\r\\n       A wayward will misleads,\\r\\n     And selfishness its shadow casts\\r\\n       On all my words and deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n     How can I learn to rule myself,\\r\\n       To be the child I should,\\r\\n     Honest and brave, nor ever tire\\r\\n       Of trying to be good?\\r\\n     How can I keep a sunny soul\\r\\n       To shine along life\\'s way?\\r\\n     How can I tune my little heart\\r\\n       To sweetly sing all day?\\r\\n\\r\\n     Dear Father, help me with the love\\r\\n       That casteth out my fear,\\r\\n     Teach me to lean on Thee, and feel\\r\\n       That Thou art very near,\\r\\n     That no temptation is unseen,\\r\\n       No childish grief too small,\\r\\n     Since Thou, with patience infinite,\\r\\n       Doth soothe and comfort all.\\r\\n\\r\\n     I do not ask for any crown\\r\\n       But that which all may win,\\r\\n     Nor seek to conquer any world,\\r\\n       Except the one within.\\r\\n     Be Thou my Guide until I find,\\r\\n       Led by a tender hand,\\r\\n     Thy happy kingdom in _myself_,\\r\\n       And dare to take command.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPICCOLA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear\\r\\n     What happened to Piccola, children dear?\\r\\n     \\'Tis seldom Fortune such favour grants\\r\\n     As fell to this little maid of France.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\'Twas Christmas-time, and her parents poor\\r\\n     Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,\\r\\n     Striving with poverty\\'s patient pain\\r\\n     Only to live till summer again.\\r\\n\\r\\n     No gifts for Piccola! Sad were they\\r\\n     When dawned the morning of Christmas-day;\\r\\n     Their little darling no joy might stir,\\r\\n     St Nicholas nothing would bring to her!\\r\\n\\r\\n     But Piccola never doubted at all\\r\\n     That something beautiful must befall\\r\\n     Every child upon Christmas-day,\\r\\n     And so she slept till the dawn was gray.\\r\\n\\r\\n     And full of faith, when at last she woke,\\r\\n     She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;\\r\\n     Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,\\r\\n     Twas plain St Nicholas had been there!\\r\\n\\r\\n     In rushed Piccola sweet, half wild:\\r\\n     Never was seen such a joyful child.\\r\\n     \"See what the good saint brought!\" she cried,\\r\\n     And mother and father must peep inside.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Now such a story who ever heard?\\r\\n     There was a little shivering bird!\\r\\n     A sparrow, that in at the window flew,\\r\\n     Had crept into Piccola\\'s tiny shoe!\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"How good poor Piccola must have been!\"\\r\\n     She cried, as happy as any queen,\\r\\n     While the starving sparrow she fed and warmed,\\r\\n     And danced with rapture, she was so charmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Children, this story I tell to you,\\r\\n     Of Piccola sweet and her bird, is true.\\r\\n     In the far-off land of France, they say,\\r\\n     Still do they live to this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE FIR TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was a very little girl some one, probably my mother, read to me\\r\\nHans Christian Andersen\\'s story of the Little Fir Tree. It happened that\\r\\nI did not read it for myself or hear it again during my childhood. One\\r\\nChristmas Day, when I was grown up, I found myself at a loss for the\\r\\n\"one more\" story called for by some little children with whom I was\\r\\nspending the holiday. In the mental search for buried treasure which\\r\\nensued, I came upon one or two word-impressions of the experiences of\\r\\nthe Little Fir Tree, and forthwith wove them into what I supposed to be\\r\\nsomething of a reproduction of the original. The latter part of the\\r\\nstory had wholly faded from my memory, so that I \"made up\" to suit the\\r\\ntastes of my audience. Afterward I told the story to a good many\\r\\nchildren, at one time or another, and it gradually took the shape it has\\r\\nhere. It was not until several years later that, in rereading Andersen\\r\\nfor other purposes, I came upon the real story of the Little Fir Tree,\\r\\nand read it for myself. Then indeed I was amused, and somewhat\\r\\ndistressed, to find how far I had wandered from the text.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give this explanation that the reader may know I do not presume to\\r\\noffer the little tale which follows as an \"adaptation\" of Andersen\\'s\\r\\nfamous story. I offer it plainly as a story which children have liked,\\r\\nand which grew out of my early memories of Andersen\\'s _The Little Fir\\r\\nTree_.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a Little Fir Tree, slim and pointed, and shiny, which\\r\\nstood in the great forest in the midst of some big fir trees, broad, and\\r\\ntall, and shadowy green. The Little Fir Tree was very unhappy because he\\r\\nwas not big like the others. When the birds came flying into the woods\\r\\nand lit on the branches of the big trees and built their nests there, he\\r\\nused to call up to them,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come down, come down, rest in my branches!\" But they always said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, no; you are too little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the splendid wind came blowing and singing through the forest, it\\r\\nbent and rocked and swung the tops of the big trees, and murmured to\\r\\nthem. Then the Little Fir Tree looked up, and called,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, dear wind, come down and play with me!\" But he always\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no; you are too little, you are too little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter the white snow fell softly, softly, and covered the great\\r\\ntrees all over with wonderful caps and coats of white. The Little Fir\\r\\nTree, close down in the cover of the others, would call up,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, dear snow, give me a cap, too! I want to play, too!\" But\\r\\nthe snow always said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, no, no; you are too little, you are too little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst of all was when men came into the wood, with sledges and teams\\r\\nof horses. They came to cut the big trees down and carry them away.\\r\\nWhenever one had been cut down and carried away the others talked about\\r\\nit, and nodded their heads, and the Little Fir Tree listened, and heard\\r\\nthem say that when you were carried away so, you might become the mast\\r\\nof a mighty ship, and go far away over the ocean, and see many wonderful\\r\\nthings; or you might be part of a fine house in a great city, and see\\r\\nmuch of life. The Little Fir Tree wanted greatly to see life, but he\\r\\nwas always too little; the men passed him by.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by and by, one cold winter\\'s morning, men came with a sledge and\\r\\nhorses, and after they had cut here and there they came to the circle of\\r\\ntrees round the Little Fir Tree, and looked all about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are none little enough,\" they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! how the Little Fir Tree pricked up his needles!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is one,\" said one of the men, \"it is just little enough.\" And he\\r\\ntouched the Little Fir Tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Fir Tree was happy as a bird, because he knew they were about\\r\\nto cut him down. And when he was being carried away on the sledge he lay\\r\\nwondering, _so_ contentedly, whether he should be the mast of a ship or\\r\\npart of a fine city house. But when they came to the town he was taken\\r\\nout and set upright in a tub and placed on the edge of a path in a row\\r\\nof other fir trees, all small, but none so little as he. And then the\\r\\nLittle Fir Tree began to see life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople kept coming to look at the trees and to take them away. But\\r\\nalways when they saw the Little Fir Tree they shook their heads and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is too little, too little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil, finally, two children came along, hand in hand, looking\\r\\ncarefully at all the small trees. When they saw the Little Fir Tree they\\r\\ncried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll take this one; it is just little enough!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took him out of his tub and carried him away, between them. And the\\r\\nhappy Little Fir Tree spent all his time wondering what it could be that\\r\\nhe was just little enough for; he knew it could hardly be a mast or a\\r\\nhouse, since he was going away with children.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe kept wondering, while they took him in through some big doors, and\\r\\nset him up in another tub, on the table, in a bare little room. Very\\r\\nsoon they went away, and came back again with a big basket, which they\\r\\ncarried between them. Then some pretty ladies, with white caps on their\\r\\nheads and white aprons over their blue dresses, came bringing little\\r\\nparcels. The children took things out of the basket and began to play\\r\\nwith the Little Fir Tree, just as he had often begged the wind and the\\r\\nsnow and the birds to do. He felt their soft little touches on his head\\r\\nand his twigs and his branches. When he looked down at himself, as far\\r\\nas he could look, he saw that he was all hung with gold and silver\\r\\nchains! There were strings of white fluffy stuff drooping around him;\\r\\nhis twigs held little gold nuts and pink, rosy balls and silver stars;\\r\\nhe had pretty little pink and white candles in his arms; but last, and\\r\\nmost wonderful of all, the children hung a beautiful white, floating\\r\\ndoll-angel over his head! The Little Fir Tree could not breathe, for joy\\r\\nand wonder. What was it that he was, now? Why was this glory for him?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time every one went away and left him. It grew dusk, and the\\r\\nLittle Fir Tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors.\\r\\nSometimes he heard a child crying. He was beginning to be lonely. It\\r\\ngrew more and more shadowy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once, the doors opened and the two children came in. Two of the\\r\\npretty ladies were with them. They came up to the Little Fir Tree and\\r\\nquickly lighted all the little pink and white candles. Then the two\\r\\npretty ladies took hold of the table with the Little Fir Tree on it and\\r\\npushed it, very smoothly and quickly, out of the doors, across a hall,\\r\\nand in at another door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Fir Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little\\r\\nwhite beds in it, of children propped up on pillows in the beds, and of\\r\\nother children in great wheeled chairs, and others hobbling about or\\r\\nsitting in little chairs. He wondered why all the little children looked\\r\\nso white and tired; he did not know that he was in a hospital. But\\r\\nbefore he could wonder any more his breath was quite taken away by the\\r\\nshout those little white children gave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! oh! m-m! m-m!\" they cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How pretty! How beautiful! Oh, isn\\'t it lovely!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew they must mean him, for all their shining eyes were looking\\r\\nstraight at him. He stood as straight as a mast, and quivered in every\\r\\nneedle, for joy. Presently one little weak child-voice called out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the nicest Christmas tree I ever saw!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, at last, the Little Fir Tree knew what he was; he was a\\r\\nChristmas tree! And from his shiny head to his feet he was glad, through\\r\\nand through, because he was just little enough to be the nicest kind of\\r\\ntree in the world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW MOSES WAS SAVED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of years ago, many years before David lived, there was a very\\r\\nwise and good man of his people who was a friend and adviser of the king\\r\\nof Egypt. And for love of this friend, the king of Egypt had let numbers\\r\\nof the Israelites settle in his land. But after the king and his\\r\\nIsraelitish friend were dead, there was a new king, who hated the\\r\\nIsraelites. When he saw how strong they were, and how many there were of\\r\\nthem, he began to be afraid that some day they might number more than\\r\\nthe Egyptians, and might take his land from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he and his rulers did a wicked thing. They made the Israelites\\r\\nslaves. And they gave them terrible tasks to do, without proper rest, or\\r\\nfood, or clothes. For they hoped that the hardship would kill off the\\r\\nIsraelites. They thought the old men would die and the young men be so\\r\\nill and weary that they could not bring up families, and so the race\\r\\nwould dwindle away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the work and suffering, the Israelites remained strong,\\r\\nand more and more boys grew up, to make the king afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he did the most wicked thing of all. He ordered his soldiers to\\r\\nkill every boy baby that should be born in an Israelitish family; he did\\r\\nnot care about the girls, because they could not grow up to fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery soon after this wicked order, a boy baby was born in a certain\\r\\nIsraelitish family. When his mother first looked at him her heart was\\r\\nnearly broken, for he was even more beautiful than most babies are,--so\\r\\nstrong and fair and sweet. But he was a boy! How could she save him from\\r\\ndeath?\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow, she contrived to keep him hidden for three whole months. But at\\r\\nthe end of that time, she saw that it would not be possible to keep him\\r\\nsafe any longer. She had been thinking all this time about what she\\r\\nshould do, and now she carried out her plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, she took a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it all over with\\r\\npitch, so that it was water-tight, and then she laid the baby in it;\\r\\nthen she carried it to the edge of the river and laid it in the flags by\\r\\nthe river\\'s brink. It did not show at all, unless one were quite near\\r\\nit. Then she kissed her little son and left him there. But his sister\\r\\nstood far off, not seeming to watch, but really watching carefully to\\r\\nsee what would happen to the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon there was the sound of talk and laughter, and a train of beautiful\\r\\nwomen came down to the water\\'s edge. It was the king\\'s daughter, come\\r\\ndown to bathe in the river, with her maidens. The maidens walked along\\r\\nby the river side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the king\\'s daughter came near to the water, she saw the strange\\r\\nlittle basket lying in the flags, and she sent her maid to bring it to\\r\\nher. And when she had opened it, she saw the child; the poor baby was\\r\\ncrying. When she saw him, so helpless and so beautiful, crying for his\\r\\nmother, the king\\'s daughter pitied him and loved him. She knew the cruel\\r\\norder of her father, and she said at once, \"This is one of the Hebrews\\'\\r\\nchildren.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the baby\\'s sister came to the princess and said, \"Shall I\\r\\ngo and find thee a nurse from the Hebrew women, so that she may nurse\\r\\nthe child for thee?\" Not a word did she say about whose child it was,\\r\\nbut perhaps the princess guessed; I don\\'t know. At all events, she told\\r\\nthe little girl to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the maiden went, and brought her mother!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king\\'s daughter said to the baby\\'s mother, \"Take this child\\r\\naway and nurse it for me, and I will give thee wages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWas not that a strange thing? And can you think how happy the baby\\'s\\r\\nmother was? For now the baby would be known only as the princess\\'s\\r\\nadopted child, and would be safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was so. The mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken\\r\\nto the princess\\'s palace. Then he was brought and given to the king\\'s\\r\\ndaughter, and he became her son. And she named him Moses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the strangest part of the whole story is, that when Moses grew to be\\r\\na man he became so strong and wise that it was he who at last saved his\\r\\npeople from the king and rescued them from the Egyptians. The one child\\r\\nsaved by the king\\'s own daughter was the very one the king would most\\r\\nhave wanted to kill, if he had known.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TEN FAIRIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl, whose name was Elsa.\\r\\nElsa\\'s father and mother worked very hard and became rich. But they\\r\\nloved Elsa so much that they did not like her to do any work; very\\r\\nfoolishly, they let her play all the time. So when Elsa grew up, she did\\r\\nnot know how to do anything; she could not make bread, she could not\\r\\nsweep a room, she could not sew a seam; she could only laugh and sing.\\r\\nBut she was so sweet and merry that everybody loved her. And by and by,\\r\\nshe married one of the people who loved her, and had a house of her own\\r\\nto take care of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, then, my dears, came hard times for Elsa! There were so many\\r\\nthings to be done in the house, and she did not know how to do any of\\r\\nthem! And because she had never worked at all it made her very tired\\r\\neven to try; she was tired before the morning was over, every day. The\\r\\nmaid would come and say, \"How shall I do this?\" or \"How shall I do\\r\\nthat?\" and Elsa would have to say, \"I don\\'t know.\" Then the maid would\\r\\npretend that she did not know, either; and when she saw her mistress\\r\\nsitting about doing nothing, she, too, sat about, idle.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsa\\'s husband had a hard time of it; he had only poor food to eat, and\\r\\nit was not ready at the right time, and the house looked all in a\\r\\nmuddle. It made him sad, and that made Elsa sad, for she wanted to do\\r\\neverything just right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, Elsa\\'s husband went away quite cross; he said to her,\\r\\nas he went out of the door, \"It is no wonder that the house looks so,\\r\\nwhen you sit all day with your hands in your lap!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Elsa cried bitterly when he was gone, for she did not want to\\r\\nmake her husband unhappy and cross, and she wanted the house to look\\r\\nnice. \"Oh, dear,\" she sobbed, \"I wish I could do things right! I wish I\\r\\ncould work! I wish--I wish I had ten good fairies to work for me! Then I\\r\\ncould keep the house!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said the words, a great grey man stood before her; he was wrapped\\r\\nin a strange grey cloak that covered him from head to foot; and he\\r\\nsmiled at Elsa. \"What is the matter, dear?\" he said. \"Why do you cry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am crying because I do not know how to keep the house,\" said\\r\\nElsa. \"I cannot make bread, I cannot sweep, I cannot sew a seam; when I\\r\\nwas a little girl I never learned to work, and now I cannot do anything\\r\\nright. I wish I had ten good fairies to help me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall have them, dear,\" said the grey man, and he shook his strange\\r\\ngrey cloak. Pouf! Out hopped ten tiny fairies, no bigger than that!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These shall be your servants, Elsa,\" said the grey man; \"they are\\r\\nfaithful and clever, and they will do everything you want them to, just\\r\\nright. But the neighbours might stare and ask questions if they saw\\r\\nthese little chaps running about your house, so I will hide them away\\r\\nfor you. Give me your little useless hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWondering, Elsa stretched out her pretty, little, white hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now stretch out your little useless fingers, dear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElsa stretched out her pretty pink fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grey man touched each one of the ten little fingers, and as he\\r\\ntouched them he said their names: \"Little Thumb; Forefinger;\\r\\nThimble-finger; Ring-finger; Little Finger; Little Thumb; Forefinger;\\r\\nThimble-finger; Ring-finger; Little Finger!\" And as he named the\\r\\nfingers, one after another, the tiny fairies bowed their tiny heads;\\r\\nthere was a fairy for every name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hop! hide yourselves away!\" said the grey man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHop, hop! The fairies sprang to Elsa\\'s knee, then to the palms of her\\r\\nhands, and then--whisk! they were all hidden away in her little pink\\r\\nfingers, a fairy in every finger! And the grey man was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsa sat and looked with wonder at her little white hands and the ten\\r\\nuseless fingers. But suddenly the little fingers began to stir. The tiny\\r\\nfairies who were hidden away there were not used to remaining still, and\\r\\nthey were getting restless. They stirred so that Elsa jumped up and ran\\r\\nto the cooking table, and took hold of the bread board. No sooner had\\r\\nshe touched the bread board than the little fairies began to work: they\\r\\nmeasured the flour, mixed the bread, kneaded the loaves, and set them to\\r\\nrise, quicker than you could wink; and when the bread was done, it was\\r\\nas nice as you could wish. Then the little fairy-fingers seized the\\r\\nbroom, and in a twinkling they were making the house clean. And so it\\r\\nwent, all day. Elsa flew about from one thing to another, and the ten\\r\\nfairies did the work, just right.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the maid saw her mistress working, she began to work, too; and when\\r\\nshe saw how beautifully everything was done, she was ashamed to do\\r\\nanything badly herself. In a little while the housework was going\\r\\nsmoothly, and Elsa could laugh and sing again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no more crossness in that house. Elsa\\'s husband grew so proud\\r\\nof her that he went about saying to everybody, \"My grandmother was a\\r\\nfine housekeeper, and my mother was a fine housekeeper, but neither of\\r\\nthem could hold a candle to my wife. She has only one maid, but, to see\\r\\nthe work done, you would think she had as many servants as she has\\r\\nfingers on her hands!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elsa heard that, she used to laugh, but she never, never told.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was an honest shoemaker, who was very poor. He\\r\\nworked as hard as he could, and still he could not earn enough to keep\\r\\nhimself and his wife. At last there came a day when he had nothing left\\r\\nbut one piece of leather, big enough to make one pair of shoes. He cut\\r\\nout the shoes, ready to stitch, and left them on the bench; then he said\\r\\nhis prayers and went to bed, trusting that he could finish the shoes on\\r\\nthe next day and sell them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBright and early the next morning, he rose and went to his work bench.\\r\\nThere lay a pair of shoes, beautifully made, and the leather was gone!\\r\\nThere was no sign of anyone having been there. The shoemaker and his\\r\\nwife did not know what to make of it. But the first customer who came\\r\\nwas so pleased with the beautiful shoes that he bought them, and paid so\\r\\nmuch that the shoemaker was able to buy leather enough for two pairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily, he cut them out, and then, as it was late, he left the pieces\\r\\non the bench, ready to sew in the morning. But when morning came, two\\r\\npairs of shoes lay on the bench, most beautifully made, and no sign of\\r\\nanyone who had been there. The shoemaker and his wife were quite at a\\r\\nloss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day a customer came and bought both pairs, and paid so much for\\r\\nthem that the shoemaker bought leather for four pairs, with the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more he cut out the shoes and left them on the bench. And in the\\r\\nmorning all four pairs were made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt went on like this until the shoemaker and his wife were prosperous\\r\\npeople. But they could not be satisfied to have so much done for them\\r\\nand not know to whom they should be grateful. So one night, after the\\r\\nshoemaker had left the pieces of leather on the bench, he and his wife\\r\\nhid themselves behind a curtain, and left a light in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the clock struck twelve the door opened softly, and two tiny\\r\\nelves came dancing into the room, hopped on to the bench, and began to\\r\\nput the pieces together. They were quite naked, but they had wee little\\r\\nscissors and hammers and thread. Tap! tap! went the little hammers;\\r\\nstitch, stitch, went the thread, and the little elves were hard at work.\\r\\nNo one ever worked so fast as they. In almost no time all the shoes were\\r\\nstitched and finished. Then the tiny elves took hold of each other\\'s\\r\\nhands and danced round the shoes on the bench, till the shoemaker and\\r\\nhis wife had hard work not to laugh aloud. But as the clock struck two,\\r\\nthe little creatures whisked away out of the window, and left the room\\r\\nall as it was before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoemaker and his wife looked at each other, and said, \"How can we\\r\\nthank the little elves who have made us happy and prosperous?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to make them some pretty clothes,\" said the wife, \"they\\r\\nare quite naked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make the shoes if you will make the coats,\" said her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very day they commenced their task. The wife cut out two tiny, tiny\\r\\ncoats of green, two weeny, weeny waistcoats of yellow, two little pairs\\r\\nof trousers, of white, two bits of caps, bright red (for every one knows\\r\\nthe elves love bright colours), and her husband made two little pairs of\\r\\nshoes with long, pointed toes. They made the wee clothes as dainty as\\r\\ncould be, with nice little stitches and pretty buttons; and by Christmas\\r\\ntime, they were finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Christmas eve, the shoemaker cleaned his bench, and on it, instead of\\r\\nleather, he laid the two sets of gay little fairy-clothes. Then he and\\r\\nhis wife hid away as before, to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromptly at midnight, the little naked elves came in. They hopped upon\\r\\nthe bench; but when they saw the little clothes there, they laughed and\\r\\ndanced for joy. Each one caught up his little coat and things and began\\r\\nto put them on. Then they looked at each other and made all kinds of\\r\\nfunny motions in their delight. At last they began to dance, and when\\r\\nthe clock struck two, they danced quite away, out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey never came back any more, but from that day they gave the shoemaker\\r\\nand his wife good luck, so that they never needed any more help.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO KILLED THE OTTER\\'S BABIES?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Otter came to the Mouse-deer and said, \"Friend Mouse-deer, will\\r\\nyou please take care of my babies while I go to the river, to catch\\r\\nfish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"go along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the Otter came back from the river, with a string of fish, he\\r\\nfound his babies crushed flat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does this mean, Friend Mouse-deer?\" he said. \"Who killed my\\r\\nchildren while you were taking care of them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"but you know I am Chief Dancer\\r\\nof the War-dance, and the Woodpecker came and sounded the war-gong, so I\\r\\ndanced. I forgot your children, and trod on them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall go to King Solomon,\" said the Otter, \"and you shall be\\r\\npunished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the Mouse-deer was called before King Solomon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you kill the Otter\\'s babies?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"but I did not mean to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did it happen?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty knows,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"that I am Chief Dancer of\\r\\nthe War-dance. The Woodpecker came and sounded the war-gong, and I had\\r\\nto dance; and as I danced I trod on the Otter\\'s children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Send for the Woodpecker,\" said King Solomon. When the Woodpecker came,\\r\\nhe said to him, \"Was it you who sounded the war-gong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said the Woodpecker, \"but I had to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty knows,\" said the Woodpecker, \"that I am Chief Beater of\\r\\nthe War-gong, and I sounded the gong because I saw the Great Lizard\\r\\nwearing his sword.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Send for the Great Lizard,\" said King Solomon. When the Great Lizard\\r\\ncame, he asked him, \"Was it you who were wearing your sword?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said the Great Lizard; \"but I had to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty knows,\" said the Great Lizard, \"that I am Chief Protector\\r\\nof the Sword. I wore my sword because the Tortoise came wearing his coat\\r\\nof mail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Tortoise was sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you wear your coat of mail?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I put it on, your Majesty,\" said the Tortoise, \"because I saw the\\r\\nKing-crab trailing his three-edged pike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the King-crab was sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why were you trailing your three-edged pike?\" said King Solomon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, your Majesty,\" said the King-crab, \"I saw that the Crayfish\\r\\nhad shouldered his lance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately the Crayfish was sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you shoulder your lance?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, your Majesty,\" said the Crayfish, \"I saw the Otter coming down\\r\\nto the river to kill my children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said King Solomon, \"if that is the case, the Otter killed the\\r\\nOtter\\'s children. And the Mouse-deer cannot be blamed, by the law of the\\r\\nland!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEARLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     I like to lie and wait to see\\r\\n       My mother braid her hair.\\r\\n     It is as long as it can be,\\r\\n       And yet she doesn\\'t care.\\r\\n     I love my mother\\'s hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n     And then the way her fingers go;\\r\\n       They look so quick and white,--\\r\\n     In and out, and to and fro,\\r\\n       And braiding in the light,\\r\\n     And it is always right.\\r\\n\\r\\n     So then she winds it, shiny brown,\\r\\n     Around her head into a crown,\\r\\n       Just like the day before.\\r\\n     And then she looks and pats it down,\\r\\n       And looks a minute more;\\r\\n     While I stay here all still and cool.\\r\\n     Oh, isn\\'t morning beautiful?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BRAHMIN, THE TIGER, AND THE JACKAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you know what a Brahmin is? A Brahmin is a very good and gentle kind\\r\\nof man who lives in India, and who treats all the beasts as if they were\\r\\nhis brothers. There is a great deal more to know about Brahmins, but\\r\\nthat is enough for the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day a Brahmin was walking along a country road when he came upon a\\r\\nTiger, shut up in a strong iron cage. The villagers had caught him and\\r\\nshut him up there for his wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Brother Brahmin, Brother Brahmin,\" said the Tiger, \"please let me\\r\\nout, to get a little drink! I am so thirsty, and there is no water\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Brother Tiger,\" said the Brahmin, \"you know if I should let you\\r\\nout, you would spring on me and eat me up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, Brother Brahmin!\" said the Tiger. \"Never in the world would I do\\r\\nsuch an ungrateful thing! Just let me out a little minute, to get a\\r\\nlittle, little drink of water, Brother Brahmin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Brahmin unlocked the door and let the Tiger out. The moment he\\r\\nwas out he sprang on the Brahmin, and was about to eat him up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Brother Tiger,\" said the Brahmin, \"you promised you would not. It\\r\\nis not fair or just that you should eat me, when I set you free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is perfectly right and just,\" said the Tiger, \"and I shall eat you\\r\\nup.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Brahmin argued so hard that at last the Tiger agreed to\\r\\nwait and ask the first five whom they should meet, whether it was fair\\r\\nfor him to eat the Brahmin, and to abide by their decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing they came to, to ask, was an old Banyan Tree, by the\\r\\nwayside. (A banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brother Banyan,\" said the Brahmin, eagerly, \"does it seem to you right\\r\\nor just that this Tiger should eat me, when I set him free from his\\r\\ncage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Banyan Tree looked down at them and spoke in a tired voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the summer,\" he said, \"when the sun is hot, men come and sit in the\\r\\ncool of my shade and refresh themselves with the fruit of my branches.\\r\\nBut when evening falls, and they are rested, they break my twigs and\\r\\nscatter my leaves, and stone my boughs for more fruit. Men are an\\r\\nungrateful race. Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger sprang to eat the Brahmin, but the Brahmin said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait, wait; we have asked only one. We have still four to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently they came to a place where an old Bullock was lying by the\\r\\nroad. The Brahmin went up to him and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brother Bullock, oh, Brother Bullock, does it seem to you a fair thing\\r\\nthat this Tiger should eat me up, after I have just freed him from a\\r\\ncage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bullock looked up, and answered in a deep, grumbling voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I was young and strong my master used me hard, and I served him\\r\\nwell. I carried heavy loads and carried them far. Now that I am old and\\r\\nweak and cannot work, he leaves me without food or water, to die by the\\r\\nwayside. Men are a thankless lot. Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger sprang, but the Brahmin spoke very quickly,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but this is only the second, Brother Tiger; you promised to ask\\r\\nfive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger grumbled a good deal, but at last he went on again with the\\r\\nBrahmin. And after a time they saw an Eagle, high overhead. The Brahmin\\r\\ncalled up to him imploringly,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Brother Eagle, Brother Eagle! Tell us if it seems to you fair that\\r\\nthis Tiger should eat me up, when I have just saved him from a frightful\\r\\ncage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagle soared slowly overhead a moment, then he came lower, and spoke\\r\\nin a thin, clear voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I live high in the air,\" he said, \"and I do no man any harm. Yet as\\r\\noften as they find my eyrie, men stone my young and rob my nest and\\r\\nshoot at me with arrows. Men are a cruel breed. Let the Tiger eat the\\r\\nBrahmin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger sprang upon the Brahmin, to eat him up; and this time the\\r\\nBrahmin had very hard work to persuade him to wait. At last he did\\r\\npersuade him, however, and they walked on together. And in a little\\r\\nwhile they saw an old Alligator, lying half buried in mud and slime, at\\r\\nthe river\\'s edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brother Alligator, oh, Brother Alligator!\" said the Brahmin, \"does it\\r\\nseem at all right or fair to you that this Tiger should eat me up, when\\r\\nI have just now let him out of a cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator turned in the mud, and grunted, and snorted; then he\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I lie here in the mud all day, as harmless as a pigeon; I hunt no man,\\r\\nyet every time a man sees me, he throws stones at me, and pokes me with\\r\\nsharp sticks, and jeers at me. Men are a worthless lot. Let the Tiger\\r\\neat the Brahmin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the Tiger was going to eat the Brahmin at once. The poor Brahmin\\r\\nhad to remind him, again and again, that they had asked only four.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait till we\\'ve asked one more! Wait until we see a fifth!\" he begged.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the Tiger walked on with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time, they met the little Jackal, coming gaily down the road\\r\\ntoward them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Brother Jackal, dear Brother Jackal,\" said the Brahmin, \"give us\\r\\nyour opinion! Do you think it right or fair that this Tiger should eat\\r\\nme, when I set him free from a terrible cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beg pardon?\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said,\" said the Brahmin, raising his voice, \"do you think it is fair\\r\\nthat the Tiger should eat me, when I set him free from his cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cage?\" said the little Jackal, vacantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, his cage,\" said the Brahmin. \"We want your opinion. Do you\\r\\nthink----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said the little Jackal, \"you want my opinion? Then may I beg you\\r\\nto speak a little more loudly, and make the matter quite clear? I am a\\r\\nlittle slow of understanding. Now what was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think,\" said the Brahmin, \"it is right for this Tiger to eat me,\\r\\nwhen I set him free from his cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What cage?\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, the cage he was in,\" said the Brahmin. \"You see----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t altogether understand,\" said the little Jackal. \"You \\'set\\r\\nhim free,\\' you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" said the Brahmin. \"It was this way: I was walking\\r\\nalong, and I saw the Tiger----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" interrupted the little Jackal; \"I never can see\\r\\nthrough it, if you go on like that, with a long story. If you really\\r\\nwant my opinion you must make the matter clear. What sort of cage was\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, a big, ordinary cage, an iron cage,\" said the Brahmin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That gives me no idea at all,\" said the little Jackal. \"See here, my\\r\\nfriends, if we are to get on with this matter you\\'d best show me the\\r\\nspot. Then I can understand in a jiffy. Show me the cage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Brahmin, the Tiger, and the little Jackal walked back together to\\r\\nthe spot where the cage was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, let us understand the situation,\" said the little Jackal. \"Friend\\r\\nBrahmin, where were you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood just here by the roadside,\" said the Brahmin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tiger, and where were you?\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, in the cage, of course,\" roared the Tiger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, Father Tiger,\" said the little Jackal, \"I\\r\\nreally am _so_ stupid; I cannot _quite_ understand what happened. If you\\r\\nwill have a little patience,--_how_ were you in the cage? What position\\r\\nwere you in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood here,\" said the Tiger, leaping into the cage, \"with my head\\r\\nover my shoulder, so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" said the little Jackal, \"that makes it\\r\\n_much_ clearer; but I still don\\'t _quite_ understand--forgive my slow\\r\\nmind--why did you not come out, by yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you see that the door shut me in?\" said the Tiger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I do beg your pardon,\" said the little Jackal. \"I know I am very\\r\\nslow; I can never understand things well unless I see just how they\\r\\nwere; if you could show me now exactly how that door works I am sure I\\r\\ncould understand. How does it shut?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shuts like this,\" said the Brahmin, pushing it to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but I don\\'t see any lock,\" said the little Jackal, \"does it lock\\r\\non the outside?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It locks like this,\" said the Brahmin. And he shut and bolted the door!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, does it, indeed?\" said the little Jackal. \"Does it, _indeed_! Well,\\r\\nBrother Brahmin, now that it is locked, I should advise you to let it\\r\\nstay locked! As for you, my friend,\" he said to the Tiger, \"I think you\\r\\nwill wait a good while before you\\'ll find anyone to let you out again!\"\\r\\nThen he made a very low bow to the Brahmin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye, Brother,\" he said. \"Your way lies that way, and mine lies\\r\\nthis; good-bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE CAMEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these stories about the little Jackal that I have told you, show how\\r\\nclever the little Jackal was. But you know--if you don\\'t, you will when\\r\\nyou are grown up--that no matter how clever you are, sooner or later you\\r\\nsurely meet some one who is more clever. It is always so in life. And it\\r\\nwas so with the little Jackal. This is what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal was, as you know, exceedingly fond of shell-fish,\\r\\nespecially of river crabs. Now there came a time when he had eaten all\\r\\nthe crabs to be found on his own side of the river. He knew there must\\r\\nbe plenty on the other side, if he could only get to them, but he could\\r\\nnot swim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he thought of a plan. He went to his friend the Camel, and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Friend Camel, I know a spot where the sugar-cane grows thick; I\\'ll show\\r\\nyou the way, if you will take me there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I will,\" said the Camel, who was very fond of sugar-cane. \"Where\\r\\nis it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is on the other side of the river,\" said the little Jackal; \"but we\\r\\ncan manage it nicely, if you will take me on your back and swim over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Camel was perfectly willing, so the little Jackal jumped on his\\r\\nback, and the Camel swam across the river, carrying him. When they were\\r\\nsafely over, the little Jackal jumped down and showed the Camel the\\r\\nsugar-cane field; then he ran swiftly along the river bank, to hunt for\\r\\ncrabs; the Camel began to eat sugar-cane. He ate happily, and noticed\\r\\nnothing around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, you know, a Camel is very big, and a Jackal is very little.\\r\\nConsequently, the little Jackal had eaten his fill by the time the Camel\\r\\nhad barely taken a mouthful. The little Jackal had no mind to wait for\\r\\nhis slow friend; he wanted to be off home again, about his business. So\\r\\nhe ran round and round the sugar-cane field, and as he ran he sang and\\r\\nshouted, and made a great hullabaloo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the villagers heard him at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a Jackal in the sugar-cane,\" they said; \"he will dig holes and\\r\\ndestroy the roots; we must go down and drive him out.\" So they came\\r\\ndown, with sticks and stones. When they got there, there was no Jackal\\r\\nto be seen; but they saw the great Camel, eating away at the juicy\\r\\nsugar-cane. They ran at him and beat him, and stoned him, and drove him\\r\\naway half dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had gone, leaving the poor Camel half killed, the little\\r\\nJackal came dancing back from somewhere or other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it\\'s time to go home, now,\" he said; \"don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you _are_ a pretty friend!\" said the Camel. \"The idea of your\\r\\nmaking such a noise, with your shouting and singing! You brought this\\r\\nupon me. What in the world made you do it? Why did you shout and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know _why_\" said the little Jackal,--\"I always sing after\\r\\ndinner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So?\" said the Camel. \"Ah, very well, let us go home now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the little Jackal kindly on his back and started into the water.\\r\\nWhen he began to swim he swam out to where the river was the very\\r\\ndeepest. There he stopped, and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jackal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have the strangest feeling,\" said the Camel,--\"I feel as if I must\\r\\nroll over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Roll over\\'!\" cried the Jackal. \"My goodness, don\\'t do that! If you do\\r\\nthat, you\\'ll drown me! What in the world makes you want to do such a\\r\\ncrazy thing? Why should you want to roll over?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know _why_,\" said the Camel slowly, \"but I always roll over\\r\\nafter dinner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he rolled over.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little Jackal was drowned, for his sins, but the Camel came\\r\\nsafely home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GULLS OF SALT LAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story I am going to tell you is about something that really\\r\\nhappened, many years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brave little company of pioneers from the Atlantic coast crossed the\\r\\nMississippi River and journeyed across the plains of Central North\\r\\nAmerica in big covered wagons with many horses, and finally succeeded in\\r\\nclimbing to the top of the great Rockies and down again into a valley in\\r\\nthe very midst of the mountains. It was a valley of brown, bare, desert\\r\\nsoil, in a climate where almost no rain falls; but the snow on the\\r\\nmountain-tops sent down little streams of pure water, the winds were\\r\\ngentle, and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was\\r\\na marvellous lake of salt water,--an inland sea. So the pioneers settled\\r\\nthere and built themselves huts and cabins for the first winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had taken them many months to make the terrible journey; many had\\r\\ndied of weariness and illness on the way; many died of hardship during\\r\\nthe winter; and the provisions they had brought in their wagons were so\\r\\nnearly gone that, by spring, they were living partly on roots, dug from\\r\\nthe ground. All their lives now depended on the crops of grain and\\r\\nvegetables which they could raise in the valley. They made the barren\\r\\nland fertile by spreading water from the little streams over it,--what\\r\\nwe call \"irrigating\"; and they planted enough corn and grain and\\r\\nvegetables for all the people. Every one helped, and every one watched\\r\\nfor the sprouting, with hopes, and prayers, and careful eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn good time the seeds sprouted, and the dry, brown earth was covered\\r\\nwith a carpet of tender, green, growing things. No farmer\\'s garden could\\r\\nhave looked better than the great garden of the desert valley. And from\\r\\nday to day the little shoots grew and flourished till they were all well\\r\\nabove the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a terrible thing happened. One day, the men who were watering the\\r\\ncrops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the\\r\\nedge of the gardens nearest the mountains. They were hopping from the\\r\\nbarren places into the young, green crops, and as they settled down they\\r\\nate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground. More came, and more, and\\r\\never more, and as they came they spread out till they covered a big\\r\\ncorner of the grain field. And still more and more, till it was like an\\r\\narmy of black, hopping, crawling crickets, streaming down the side of\\r\\nthe mountain to kill the crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down, but the\\r\\nnumbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea. Then they ran\\r\\nand told the terrible news, and all the village came to help. They\\r\\nstarted fires; they dug trenches and filled them with water; they ran\\r\\nwildly about in the fields, killing what they could. But while they\\r\\nfought in one place new armies of crickets marched down the\\r\\nmountain-sides and attacked the fields in other places. And at last the\\r\\npeople fell on their knees and wept and cried in despair, for they saw\\r\\nstarvation and death in the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few knelt to pray. Others gathered round and joined them, weeping.\\r\\nMore left their useless struggles and knelt beside their neighbours. At\\r\\nlast nearly all the people were kneeling on the desolate fields praying\\r\\nfor deliverance from the plague of crickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, from far off in the air toward the great salt lake, there was\\r\\nthe sound of flapping wings. It grew louder. Some of the people looked\\r\\nup, startled. They saw, like a white cloud rising from the lake, a flock\\r\\nof sea gulls flying toward them. Snow-white in the sun, with great wings\\r\\nbeating and soaring, in hundreds and hundreds, they rose and circled and\\r\\ncame on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gulls! the gulls!\" was the cry. \"What does it mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gulls flew overhead, with a shrill chorus of whimpering cries, and\\r\\nthen, in a marvellous white cloud of outspread wings and hovering\\r\\nbreasts, they settled down over the cultivated ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! woe! woe!\" cried the people. \"The gulls are eating what the\\r\\ncrickets have left! they will strip root and branch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all at once, someone called out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no! See! they are eating the crickets! They are eating only the\\r\\ncrickets!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true. The gulls devoured the crickets in dozens, in hundreds, in\\r\\nswarms. They ate until they were gorged, and then they flew heavily back\\r\\nto the lake, only to come again with new appetite. And when at last they\\r\\nfinished, they had stripped the fields of the army of crickets; and the\\r\\npeople were saved.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this day, in the beautiful city of Salt Lake, which grew out of that\\r\\npioneer village, the little children are taught to love the sea gulls.\\r\\nAnd when they learn drawing and weaving in the schools, their first\\r\\ndesign is often a picture of a cricket and a gull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NIGHTINGALE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long, long time ago, as long ago as when there were fairies, there\\r\\nlived an emperor in China, who had a most beautiful palace, all made of\\r\\ncrystal. Outside the palace was the loveliest garden in the whole world,\\r\\nand farther away was a forest where the trees were taller than any other\\r\\ntrees in the world, and farther away, still, was a deep wood. And in\\r\\nthis wood lived a little Nightingale. The Nightingale sang so\\r\\nbeautifully that everybody who heard her remembered her song better than\\r\\nanything else that he heard or saw. People came from all over the world\\r\\nto see the crystal palace and the wonderful garden and the great forest;\\r\\nbut when they went home and wrote books about these things they always\\r\\nwrote, \"But the Nightingale is the best of all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it happened that the Emperor came upon a book which said this,\\r\\nand he at once sent for his Chamberlain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is this Nightingale?\" said the Emperor. \"Why have I never heard him\\r\\nsing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain, who was a very important person, said, \"There cannot be\\r\\nany such person; I have never heard his name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The book says there is a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor. \"I command\\r\\nthat the Nightingale be brought here to sing for me this evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain went out and asked all the great lords and ladies and\\r\\npages where the Nightingale could be found, but not one of them had ever\\r\\nheard of him. So the Chamberlain went back to the Emperor and said,\\r\\n\"There is no such person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The book says there is a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor; \"if the\\r\\nNightingale is not here to sing for me this evening I will have the\\r\\ncourt trampled upon, immediately after supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain did not want to be trampled upon, so he ran out and\\r\\nasked everybody in the palace about the Nightingale. At last, a little\\r\\ngirl who worked in the kitchen to help the cook, said, \"Oh, yes, I know\\r\\nthe Nightingale very well. Every night, when I go to carry scraps from\\r\\nthe kitchen to my mother, who lives in the wood beyond the forest, I\\r\\nhear the Nightingale sing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the Nightingale\\'s home,\\r\\nand many of the lords and ladies followed after. When they had gone a\\r\\nlittle way, they heard a cow moo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said the lords and ladies, \"that must be the Nightingale; what a\\r\\nlarge voice for so small a creature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"that is just a cow, mooing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little farther on they heard some bullfrogs, in a swamp. \"Surely that\\r\\nis the Nightingale,\" said the courtiers; \"it really sounds like\\r\\nchurch-bells!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"those are bullfrogs, croaking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they came to the wood where the Nightingale was. \"Hush!\" said\\r\\nthe little girl, \"she is going to sing.\" And, sure enough, the little\\r\\nNightingale began to sing. She sang so beautifully that you have never\\r\\nin all your life heard anything like it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear,\" said the courtiers, \"that is very pleasant; does that\\r\\nlittle grey bird really make all that noise? She is so pale that I think\\r\\nshe has lost her colour for fear of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain asked the little Nightingale to come and sing for the\\r\\nEmperor. The little Nightingale said she could sing better in her own\\r\\ngreenwood, but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening the palace was all trimmed with the most beautiful flowers\\r\\nyou can imagine, and rows and rows of little silver bells, that tinkled\\r\\nwhen the wind blew in, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of wax\\r\\ncandles, that shone like tiny stars. In the great hall there was a gold\\r\\nperch for the Nightingale, beside the Emperor\\'s throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all the people were there, the Emperor asked the Nightingale to\\r\\nsing. Then the little grey Nightingale filled her throat full, and sang.\\r\\nAnd, my dears, she sang so beautifully that the Emperor\\'s eyes filled up\\r\\nwith tears! And, you know, emperors do not cry at all easily. So he\\r\\nasked her to sing again, and this time she sang so marvellously that\\r\\nthe tears came out of his eyes and ran down his cheeks. That was a great\\r\\nsuccess. They asked the little Nightingale to sing, over and over again,\\r\\nand when they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be\\r\\nmade \"Singer in Chief to the Court.\" She was to have a golden perch near\\r\\nthe Emperor\\'s bed, and a little golden cage, and was to be allowed to go\\r\\nout twice every day. But there were twelve servants appointed to wait on\\r\\nher, and those twelve servants went with her every time she went out,\\r\\nand each of the twelve had hold of the end of a silken string which was\\r\\ntied to the little Nightingale\\'s leg! It was not so very much fun to go\\r\\nout that way!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long, long time the Nightingale sang every evening to the Emperor\\r\\nand his court, and they liked her so much that the ladies all tried to\\r\\nsing like her; they used to put water in their mouths and then make\\r\\nlittle sounds like this: _glu-glu-glug_. And when the courtiers met each\\r\\nother in the halls, one would say \"Night,\" and the other would say\\r\\n\"ingale,\" and that was supposed to be conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, there came a little package to the Emperor, on the\\r\\noutside of which was written, \"The Nightingale.\" Inside was an\\r\\nartificial bird, something like a Nightingale, only it was made of gold,\\r\\nand silver, and rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds. When it was wound\\r\\nup it played a waltz tune, and as it played it moved its little tail up\\r\\nand down. Everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of\\r\\nthe new nightingale. They made it sing that same tune thirty-three\\r\\ntimes, and still they had not had enough. They would have made it sing\\r\\nthe tune thirty-four times, but the Emperor said, \"I should like to hear\\r\\nthe real Nightingale sing, now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when they looked about for the real little Nightingale, they could\\r\\nnot find her anywhere! She had taken the chance, while everybody was\\r\\nlistening to the waltz tunes, to fly away through the window to her own\\r\\ngreenwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a very ungrateful bird!\" said the lords and ladies. \"But it does\\r\\nnot matter; the new nightingale is just as good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the artificial nightingale was given the real Nightingale\\'s little\\r\\ngold perch, and every night the Emperor wound her up, and she sang waltz\\r\\ntunes to him. The people in the court liked her even better than the old\\r\\nNightingale, because they could all whistle her tunes,--which you can\\'t\\r\\ndo with real nightingales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a year after the artificial nightingale came, the Emperor was\\r\\nlistening to her waltz tune, when there was a _snap_ and _whir-r-r_\\r\\ninside the bird, and the music stopped. The Emperor ran to his doctor,\\r\\nbut he could not do anything. Then he ran to his clock-maker, but he\\r\\ncould not do much. Nobody could do much. The best they could do was to\\r\\npatch the gold nightingale up so that it could sing once a year; even\\r\\nthat was almost too much, and the tune was very shaky. Still, the\\r\\nEmperor kept the gold nightingale on the perch in his own room.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time went by, and then, at last, the Emperor grew very ill, and\\r\\nwas about to die. When it was sure that he could not live much longer,\\r\\nthe people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die. The\\r\\npoor Emperor lay, quite cold and pale, in his great big bed, with velvet\\r\\ncurtains and tall candlesticks all about. He was quite alone, for all\\r\\nthe courtiers had gone to congratulate the new emperor, and all the\\r\\nservants had gone to talk it over.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Emperor woke up, he felt a terrible weight on his chest. He\\r\\nopened his eyes, and there was Death, sitting on his heart. Death had\\r\\nput on the Emperor\\'s gold crown, and he had the gold sceptre in one\\r\\nhand, and the silken banner in the other; and he looked at the Emperor\\r\\nwith his great hollow eyes. The room was full of shadows, and the\\r\\nshadows were full of faces. Everywhere the Emperor looked, there were\\r\\nfaces. Some were very, very ugly, and some were sweet and lovely; they\\r\\nwere all the things the Emperor had done in his life, good and bad. And\\r\\nas he looked at them they began to whisper. They whispered, \"_Do you\\r\\nremember this?_\" \"_Do you remember that?_\" The Emperor remembered so\\r\\nmuch that he cried out loud, \"Oh, bring the great drum! Make music, so\\r\\nthat I may not hear these dreadful whispers!\" But there was nobody there\\r\\nto bring the drum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Emperor cried, \"You little gold nightingale, can you not sing\\r\\nsomething for me? I have given you gifts of gold and jewels, and kept\\r\\nyou always by my side; will you not help me now?\" But there was nobody\\r\\nto wind the little gold nightingale up, and of course it could not sing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor\\'s heart grew colder and colder where Death crouched upon it,\\r\\nand the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder, and the Emperor\\'s life\\r\\nwas almost gone. Suddenly, through the open window, there came a most\\r\\nlovely song. It was so sweet and so loud that the whispers died quite\\r\\naway. Presently the Emperor felt his heart grow warm, then he felt the\\r\\nblood flow through his limbs again; he listened to the song until the\\r\\ntears ran down his cheeks; he knew that it was the little real\\r\\nNightingale who had flown away from him when the gold nightingale came.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath was listening to the song, too; and when it was done and the\\r\\nEmperor begged for more, Death, too, said, \"Please sing again, little\\r\\nNightingale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s gold crown for a song?\" said the little\\r\\nNightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s crown\\r\\nfor a song.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sing again, little Nightingale,\" begged Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s sceptre for another song?\" said the\\r\\nlittle grey Nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s\\r\\nsceptre for another song.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more Death begged for a song, and this time the little Nightingale\\r\\nobtained the banner for her singing. Then she sang one more song, so\\r\\nsweet and so sad that it made Death think of his garden in the\\r\\nchurchyard, where he always liked best to be. And he rose from the\\r\\nEmperor\\'s heart and floated away through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Death was gone, the Emperor said to the little Nightingale, \"Oh,\\r\\ndear little Nightingale, you have saved me from Death! Do not leave me\\r\\nagain. Stay with me on this little gold perch, and sing to me always!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dear Emperor,\" said the little Nightingale, \"I sing best when I am\\r\\nfree; I cannot live in a palace. But every night when you are quite\\r\\nalone, I will come and sit in the window and sing to you, and tell you\\r\\neverything that goes on in your kingdom: I will tell you where the poor\\r\\npeople are who ought to be helped, and where the wicked people are who\\r\\nought to be punished. Only, dear Emperor, be sure that you never let\\r\\nanybody know that you have a little bird who tells you everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the little Nightingale had flown away, the Emperor felt so well\\r\\nand strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold\\r\\nsceptre in his hand. And when the courtiers came in to see if he were\\r\\ndead, there stood the Emperor with his sword in one hand and his sceptre\\r\\nin the other, and said, \"Good-morning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARGERY\\'S GARDEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a little girl named Margery, who had always lived in the\\r\\ncity. The flat where her mother and father lived was at the top of a big\\r\\nbuilding, and you couldn\\'t see a great deal from the windows, except\\r\\nchimney-pots on other people\\'s roofs. Margery did not know much about\\r\\ntrees and flowers, but she loved them dearly; whenever it was a fine\\r\\nSunday she used to go with her mother and father to the park and look at\\r\\nthe lovely flower-beds. They seemed always to be finished, though, and\\r\\nMargery was always wishing she could see them grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne spring, when Margery was nine, her father obtained a new situation\\r\\nand they removed to a little house with a nice big piece of ground a\\r\\nshort distance outside the town where his new position was. Margery was\\r\\ndelighted. And the very first thing she said, when her father told her\\r\\nabout it, was, \"Oh, may I have a garden? _May_ I have a garden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery\\'s mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was, and\\r\\nMargery\\'s father said he expected to live on their vegetables all the\\r\\nrest of his life! So it was soon agreed that the garden should be the\\r\\nfirst thing attended to.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the cottage were apple trees, a plum tree, and two or three pear\\r\\ntrees; then came a stretch of rough grass, and then a stone wall, with a\\r\\ngate leading into the fields. It was on the grass plot that the garden\\r\\nwas to be. A big piece was to be used for wheat and peas and beans, and\\r\\na little piece at the end was to be given to Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shall we have in it?\" asked her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Flowers,\" said Margery, with shining eyes,--\"blue, and white, and\\r\\nyellow, and pink,--every kind of flower!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely, flowers,\" said her mother, \"and shall we not have a little\\r\\nsalad garden in the middle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is a salad garden?\" Margery asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, laughing, for Margery was fond of salads; \"you have\\r\\nlettuce, and endive, and mustard and cress, and parsley, and radishes,\\r\\nand beetroot, and young onions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! how good it sounds!\" said Margery. \"I should love a salad garden.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very evening, Margery\\'s father took pencil and paper, and drew out\\r\\na plan for her garden; first, they talked it all over, then he drew what\\r\\nthey decided on; it looked like the diagram on the next page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The outside strip is for flowers,\" said Margery\\'s father, \"and next is\\r\\na footpath, all the way round the beds; that is to let you get at the\\r\\nflowers to weed and to pick; there is a wider path through the middle,\\r\\nand the rest is for rows of salad vegetables.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Papa, it is glorious!\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapa laughed. \"I hope you will still think it glorious when the weeding\\r\\ntime comes,\" he said, \"for you know, you and mother have promised to\\r\\ntake care of this garden, while I take care of the big one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t _not_ take care of it for anything!\" said Margery. \"I want\\r\\nto feel that it is my very own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father kissed her, and said it was certainly her \"very own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo evenings after that, when Margery was called in from her first\\r\\nramble in the fields, she found the postman at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something for you, Margery,\" said her mother, with the look she had\\r\\nwhen something nice was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a box, quite a big box, with a label on it that said:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     MISS MARGERY BROWN,\\r\\n         PRIMROSE COTTAGE,\\r\\n               21 NARCISSUS ROAD,\\r\\n                     COLCHESTER.\\r\\n\\r\\n     From Seeds and Plants Company, Reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery could hardly wait to open it. It was filled with little\\r\\npackages, all with printed labels; and in the packages, of course, were\\r\\nseeds. It made Margery dance, just to read the names,--nasturtium, giant\\r\\nhelianthus, canariensis, calendula, Canterbury bells: more names than I\\r\\ncan tell you; and other packages, bigger, that said, \"Sweet Peas,\"\\r\\n\"French beans,\" \"Carrots,\" \"Wallflowers,\" and such things! Margery could\\r\\nalmost smell the posies, she was so excited. Only, she had seen so\\r\\nlittle of flowers that she did not know what all the names meant. She\\r\\ndid not know that a helianthus was a sunflower until her mother told her\\r\\nso, and she had never seen the dear, blue, bell-shaped flowers that\\r\\nalways grow in old-fashioned gardens, and are called Canterbury bells.\\r\\nShe thought the calendula must be a strange, grand flower, by its name;\\r\\nbut her mother told her it was the gay, sturdy, everydayish little\\r\\nflower called a marigold. There was a great deal for a little city girl\\r\\nto be surprised about, and it did seem as if morning was a long way off!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you think you could plant them in the morning?\" asked her mother.\\r\\n\"You know, dear, the ground has to be made ready first; it takes a\\r\\nlittle time,--it may be several days before you can plant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was another surprise. Margery had thought she could begin to sow\\r\\nthe seed right off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was what had happened. Early the next morning, a man came\\r\\ndriving up to the cottage with two strong white horses; in his wagon was\\r\\na plough. I suppose you have seen ploughs, but Margery never had, and\\r\\nshe watched with great interest, while the man and her father took the\\r\\nplough from the cart and harnessed the horses to it. It was a great,\\r\\nthree-cornered piece of sharp steel, with long handles coming up from\\r\\nit, so that a man could hold it in place. It looked like this:--\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I brought a two-horse plough because it\\'s virgin soil,\" the man said.\\r\\nMargery wondered what in the world he meant; it had not been\\r\\ncultivated, of course, but what had that do with the kind of plough?\\r\\n\"What does he mean, father?\" she whispered, when she got a chance. \"He\\r\\nmeans that this land has not been ploughed before; it will be hard to\\r\\nturn the soil, and one horse could not pull the plough,\" said her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took the man two hours to plough the little strip of land. He drove\\r\\nthe sharp end of the plough into the soil, and held it firmly so, while\\r\\nthe horses drew it along in a straight line. Margery found it\\r\\nfascinating to watch the long line of dark earth and green grass come\\r\\nrolling up and turn over, as the knife passed it. She could see that it\\r\\ntook real skill and strength to keep the line even, and to avoid the\\r\\nstones. Sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone, and then the man was\\r\\njerked almost off his feet. But he only laughed, and said, \"Tough piece\\r\\nof land; it will be a lot better next year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had ploughed, the man went back to his cart and unloaded another\\r\\nfarm implement. This one was like a three-cornered platform of wood,\\r\\nwith a long, curved, strong rake under it. It was called a harrow, and\\r\\nit looked like the diagram on the next page.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man harnessed the horses to it, and then he stood on the platform\\r\\nand drove all over the strip of land. It was fun to watch, but perhaps\\r\\nit was a little hard to do. The man\\'s weight kept the harrow steady,\\r\\nand let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up, so that it\\r\\ndid not stay in ridges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He scrambles the ground, father!\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It needs \\'scrambling,\\'\" laughed her father. \"We are going to get more\\r\\nweeds than we want on this fresh soil, and the more the ground is\\r\\nbroken, the fewer there will be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ploughing and harrowing, the man drove off, and Margery\\'s\\r\\nfather said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late\\r\\nafternoons, when he came home from business; they could not afford too\\r\\nmuch help, he said, and he had learned to take care of a garden when he\\r\\nwas a boy. So Margery did not see any more done until the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the next day there was hard work for Margery\\'s father! Every bit of\\r\\nthat ground had to be broken up still more with a spade, and then the\\r\\nclods which were full of grass-roots had to be taken on a fork and\\r\\nshaken, till the earth fell out; when the grass was thrown to one side.\\r\\nThat would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the\\r\\nautumn; the grass would have rotted in the ground, and would have made\\r\\nfood for the plants. Now, Margery\\'s father put the fertiliser on the\\r\\ntop, and then raked it into the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, it was time to make the place for the seeds. Margery and her\\r\\nmother helped. Father tied one end of a cord to a little stake, and\\r\\ndrove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden. Then he took the\\r\\ncord to the other end of the garden and pulled it tight, tied it to\\r\\nanother stake, and drove that down. That made a straight line. Then he\\r\\nhoed a trench, a few inches deep, the whole length of the cord, and\\r\\nscattered fertiliser in it. Pretty soon the whole garden was lined with\\r\\nlittle trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for the seed,\" said father.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery ran and brought the seed box. \"May I help?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you watch me sow one row, I think you can do the next,\" said her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Margery watched. Her father took a handful of peas, and, stooping,\\r\\nwalked slowly along the line, letting the seed trickle through his\\r\\nfingers. It was pretty to watch; it made Margery think of a photograph\\r\\nher teacher had, a photograph of a famous picture called \"The Sower.\"\\r\\nPerhaps you have seen it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting in the seed was not so easy to do as to watch; sometimes Margery\\r\\ndropped in too much, and sometimes not enough; but her father was\\r\\npatient with her, and soon she did better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey planted peas, beans, spinach, carrots, and parsnips. And Margery\\'s\\r\\nfather made a row of holes, after that, for the tomato plants. He said\\r\\nthose had to be transplanted; they could not be sown from seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seeds were in the trenches they had to be covered up, and\\r\\nMargery really helped at that. It is fun to do it. You stand beside the\\r\\nlittle trench and walk backward, and as you walk you hoe the loose earth\\r\\nback over the seeds; the same earth that was hoed up you pull back\\r\\nagain. Then you rake very gently over the surface, with the back of a\\r\\nrake, to even it all off. Margery liked it, because now the garden began\\r\\nto look _like_ a garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut best of all was the work next day, when her own little particular\\r\\ngarden was begun. Father Brown loved Margery and Margery\\'s mother so\\r\\nmuch that he wanted their garden to be perfect, and that meant a great\\r\\ndeal more work. He knew very well that the old grass would begin to come\\r\\nthrough again on such soil, and that it would make terribly hard\\r\\nweeding. He was not going to have any such thing for his two \"little\\r\\ngirls,\" as he called them. So he gave that little garden particular\\r\\nattention. This is what he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had thrown out all the turf, he shovelled clean earth on to the\\r\\ngarden,--as much as three solid inches of it; not a bit of grass was in\\r\\nthat. Then it was ready for raking and fertilising, and for the lines.\\r\\nThe little footpaths were marked out by Father Brown\\'s feet; Margery and\\r\\nher mother laughed well at his actions, for it looked like some kind of\\r\\ndance. Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy, and\\r\\nhe did it very nicely: he walked along the sides of the square, with one\\r\\nfoot turned a little out, and the other straight, taking such tiny steps\\r\\nthat his feet touched each other all the time. This tramped out a path\\r\\njust wide enough for a person to walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wider path was marked with lines and raked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery thought, of course, all the flowers would be put in as the\\r\\nvegetables were; but she found that it was not so. For some, her father\\r\\npoked little holes with his finger; for some, he made very shallow\\r\\ntrenches; and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top\\r\\nof the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the\\r\\narrangement of the flowers, that perhaps you will like to hear just how\\r\\nthey designed that garden. At the back were the sweet peas, which would\\r\\ngrow tall, like a screen; on the two sides, for a kind of hedge, were\\r\\nyellow sunflowers; and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums.\\r\\nMargery planned that, so that she could look into the garden from the\\r\\nfront, but have it shut away from the vegetable patch by the tall\\r\\nflowers on the sides. The two front corners had canariensis in them.\\r\\nCanariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms, very dainty and\\r\\nbright. And then, in little square patches all round the garden, were\\r\\nplanted London pride, blue bachelor\\'s buttons, yellow marigolds, tall\\r\\nlarkspur, many-coloured asters, hollyhocks and stocks. All these lovely\\r\\nflowers used to grow in our grandmothers\\' gardens, and if you don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat they look like, I hope you can find out next summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that\\r\\nwonderful salad garden; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery\\r\\nwere there. Margery had never seen anything more wonderful than the\\r\\nlittle round lettuce-seeds. They were so tiny that it did not seem\\r\\npossible that green lettuce leaves could come from them. But they surely\\r\\nwould.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening. But they\\r\\nwere all so happy that it did not matter. The last thing Margery\\r\\nthought of, as she went to sleep at night, was the dear, smooth little\\r\\ngarden, with its funny footpath, and with the little sticks standing at\\r\\nthe ends of the rows, labelled \"lettuce,\" \"beets,\" \"helianthus,\" and so\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a garden! I have a garden!\" was Margery\\'s last thought as she\\r\\nwent off to dreamland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE COTYLEDONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is another story about Margery\\'s garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning after the garden was planted, Margery was up and out at\\r\\nsix o\\'clock. She could not wait to look at her garden. To be sure, she\\r\\nknew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night, but she had a\\r\\nfeeling that _something_ might happen at any moment. The garden was just\\r\\nas smooth and brown as the night before, and no little seedlings were in\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a very few mornings after that, when Margery went out, she saw a\\r\\nfunny little crack opening up through the earth, the whole length of the\\r\\npatch. Quickly she knelt down on the footpath, to see. Yes! Tiny green\\r\\nleaves, a whole row of them, were pushing their way through the crust!\\r\\nMargery knew what she had put there: it was the radish-row; these must\\r\\nbe radish leaves. She examined them very closely, so that she might\\r\\nknow a radish next time. The little leaves, no bigger than half your\\r\\nlittle-finger nail, grew in twos,--two on each tiny stem; they were\\r\\nalmost round.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery flew back to her mother, to say that the first seeds were up.\\r\\nAnd her mother, nearly as excited as Margery, came to look at the little\\r\\ncrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach day, after that, the row of radishes grew, till, in a week, it\\r\\nstood as high as your finger, green and sturdy. But about the third day,\\r\\nwhile Margery was stooping over the radishes, she saw something very,\\r\\nvery small and green, peeping above ground, where the lettuce was\\r\\nplanted. Could it be weeds? No, for on looking very closely she saw that\\r\\nthe wee leaves faintly marked a regular row. They did not make a crack,\\r\\nlike the radishes; they seemed too small and too far apart to push the\\r\\nearth up like that. Margery leaned down and looked with all her eyes at\\r\\nthe baby plants. The tiny leaves grew two on a stem, and were almost\\r\\nround. The more she looked at them the more it seemed to Margery that\\r\\nthey looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up. \"Do you\\r\\nsuppose,\" Margery said to herself, \"that lettuce and radish look alike\\r\\nwhile they are growing? They don\\'t look alike when they are on the\\r\\ntable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDay by day the lettuce grew, and soon the little round leaves were\\r\\neasier to examine; they certainly were very much like radish leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one morning, while she was searching for signs of other seeds,\\r\\nMargery discovered the beets. In irregular patches on the row, hints of\\r\\ngreen were coming. The next day and the next they grew, until the beet\\r\\nleaves were big enough to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery looked. Then she looked again. Then she wrinkled her forehead.\\r\\n\"Can we have made a mistake?\" she thought. \"Do you suppose we can have\\r\\nplanted _all_ radishes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those little beet leaves were almost round, and they grew two on a\\r\\nstem, precisely like the lettuce and the radish; except for the size,\\r\\nall three rows looked alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too much for Margery. She ran to the house and found her father.\\r\\nHer little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had\\r\\nhappened. \"Papa,\" she said, all out of breath, \"do you think we could\\r\\nhave made a mistake about my garden? Do you think we could have put\\r\\nradishes in all the rows?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFather laughed. \"What makes you think such a thing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Papa,\" said Margery, \"the little leaves all look exactly alike! every\\r\\nplant has just two tiny leaves on it, and shaped the same; they are\\r\\nroundish, and grow out of the stem at the same place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPapa\\'s eyes began to twinkle. \"Many of the dicotyledonous plants look\\r\\nalike at the beginning,\" he said, with a little drawl on the big word.\\r\\nThat was to tease Margery, because she always wanted to know the big\\r\\nwords she heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s \\'dicotyledonous\\'?\" said Margery, carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait till I come home to-night, dear,\" said her father, \"and I\\'ll tell\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening Margery was waiting eagerly for him. When her father\\r\\nfinished his supper they went together to the garden, and father\\r\\nexamined the seedlings carefully. Then he pulled up a little radish\\r\\nplant and a tiny beet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These little leaves,\" he said, \"are not the real leaves of the plant;\\r\\nthey are only little pockets to hold food for the plant to live on till\\r\\nit gets strong enough to push up into the air. As soon as the real\\r\\nleaves come out and begin to draw food from the air, these little\\r\\nsubstitutes wither up and fall off. These two lie folded up in the\\r\\nlittle seed from the beginning, and are full of plant food. They don\\'t\\r\\nhave to be very special in shape, you see, because they don\\'t stay on\\r\\nthe plant after it is grown up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then every plant looks like this at first?\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dear, not every one; plants are divided into two kinds: those which\\r\\nhave two food leaves, like these plants, and those which have only one;\\r\\nthese are called dicotyledonous, and the ones which have but one food\\r\\nleaf are monocotyledonous. Many of the dicotyledons look alike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that is interesting,\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always, supposed the plants were different from the minute they began\\r\\nto grow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, no,\" said father. \"Even some of the trees look like this when\\r\\nthey first come through; you would not think a birch tree could look\\r\\nlike a vegetable or a flower, would you? But it does, at first; it looks\\r\\nso much like these things that in the great nurseries, where trees are\\r\\nraised for forests and parks, the workmen have to be very carefully\\r\\ntrained, or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding.\\r\\nThey have to be taught the difference between a birch tree and a weed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How funny!\" said Margery, dimpling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it sounds funny,\" said father; \"but, you see, the birch tree is\\r\\ndicotyledonous, and so are many weeds, and the dicotyledons look so much\\r\\nalike at first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad to know that, father,\" said Margery, soberly. \"I believe I\\r\\nshall learn a good deal from living in the country; don\\'t you think so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery\\'s father took her in his arms. \"I hope so, dear,\" he said; \"the\\r\\ncountry is a good place for little girls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was all that happened, that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALKATIVE TORTOISE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a Tortoise lived in a pond with two Ducks, who were\\r\\nher very good friends. She enjoyed the company of the Ducks, because she\\r\\ncould talk with them to her heart\\'s content; the Tortoise liked to talk.\\r\\nShe always had something to say, and she liked to hear herself say it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many years of this pleasant living, the pond became very low, in a\\r\\ndry season; and finally it dried up. The two Ducks saw that they could\\r\\nno longer live there, so they decided to fly to another region, where\\r\\nthere was more water. They went to the Tortoise to bid her good-bye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t leave me behind!\" begged the Tortoise. \"Take me with you; I\\r\\nmust die if I am left here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you cannot fly!\" said the Ducks. \"How can we take you with us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take me with you! take me with you!\" said the Tortoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ducks felt so sorry for her that at last they thought of a way to\\r\\ntake her. \"We have thought of a way which will be possible,\" they said,\\r\\n\"if only you can manage to keep still long enough. We will each take\\r\\nhold of one end of a stout stick, and do you take the middle in your\\r\\nmouth; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us.\\r\\nBut remember not to talk! If you open your mouth, you are lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tortoise said she would not say a word; she would not so much as\\r\\nmove her mouth; and she was very grateful. So the Ducks brought a strong\\r\\nlittle stick and took hold of the ends, while the Tortoise bit firmly on\\r\\nthe middle. Then the two Ducks rose slowly in the air and flew away with\\r\\ntheir burden.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were above the treetops, the Tortoise wanted to say, \"How high\\r\\nwe are!\" But she remembered, and kept still. When they passed the church\\r\\nsteeple she wanted to say, \"What is that which shines?\" But she\\r\\nremembered, and held her peace. Then they came over the village square,\\r\\nand the people looked up and saw them. \"Look at the Ducks carrying a\\r\\nTortoise!\" they shouted; and every one ran to look. The Tortoise wanted\\r\\nto say, \"What business is it of yours?\" But she didn\\'t. Then she heard\\r\\nthe people shout, \"Isn\\'t it strange! Look at it! Look!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tortoise forgot everything except that she wanted to say, \"Hush, you\\r\\nfoolish people!\" She opened her mouth,--and fell to the ground. And that\\r\\nwas the end of the Tortoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a very good thing to be able to hold one\\'s tongue!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROBERT OF SICILY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old legend says that there was once a king named Robert of Sicily,\\r\\nwho was brother to the Great Pope of Rome and to the Emperor of\\r\\nAllemaine. He was a very selfish king, and very proud; he cared more for\\r\\nhis pleasures than for the needs of his people, and his heart was so\\r\\nfilled with his own greatness that he had no thought for God.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, this proud king was sitting in his place at church, at vesper\\r\\nservice; his courtiers were about him, in their bright garments, and he\\r\\nhimself was dressed in his royal robes. The choir was chanting the Latin\\r\\nservice, and as the beautiful voices swelled louder, the king noticed\\r\\none particular verse which seemed to be repeated again and again. He\\r\\nturned to a learned clerk at his side and asked what those words meant,\\r\\nfor he knew no Latin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They mean, \\'He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and hath\\r\\nexalted them of low degree,\\'\" answered the clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well the words are in Latin, then,\" said the king angrily, \"for\\r\\nthey are a lie. There is no power on earth or in heaven which can put me\\r\\ndown from my seat!\" and he sneered at the beautiful singing, as he\\r\\nleaned back in his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the king fell asleep, while the service went on. He slept\\r\\ndeeply and long. When he awoke the church was dark and still, and he was\\r\\nall alone. He, the king, had been left alone in the church, to awake in\\r\\nthe dark! He was furious with rage and surprise, and, stumbling through\\r\\nthe dim aisles, he reached the great doors and beat at them, madly,\\r\\nshouting for his servants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old sexton heard some one shouting and pounding in the church, and\\r\\nthought it was some drunken vagabond who had stolen in during the\\r\\nservice. He came to the door with his keys and called out, \"Who is\\r\\nthere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open! open! It is I, the king!\" came a hoarse, angry voice from within.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a crazy man,\" thought the sexton; and he was frightened. He\\r\\nopened the doors carefully and stood back, peering into the darkness.\\r\\nOut past him rushed the figure of a man in tattered, scanty clothes,\\r\\nwith unkempt hair and white, wild face. The sexton did not know that he\\r\\nhad ever seen him before, but he looked long after him, wondering at his\\r\\nwildness and his haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his fluttering rags, without hat or cloak, not knowing what strange\\r\\nthing had happened to him, King Robert rushed to his palace gates,\\r\\npushed aside the startled servants, and hurried, blind with rage, up the\\r\\nwide stair and through the great corridors, toward the room where he\\r\\ncould hear the sound of his courtiers\\' voices. Men and women servants\\r\\ntried to stop the ragged man, who had somehow got into the palace, but\\r\\nRobert did not even see them as he fled along. Straight to the open\\r\\ndoors of the big banquet hall he made his way, and into the midst of the\\r\\ngrand feast there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great hall was filled with lights and flowers; the tables were set\\r\\nwith everything that is delicate and rich to eat; the courtiers, in\\r\\ntheir gay clothes, were laughing and talking; and at the head of the\\r\\nfeast, on the king\\'s own throne, sat a king. His face, his figure, his\\r\\nvoice were exactly like Robert of Sicily; no human being could have told\\r\\nthe difference; no one dreamed that he was not the king. He was dressed\\r\\nin the king\\'s royal robes, he wore the royal crown, and on his hand was\\r\\nthe king\\'s own ring. Robert of Sicily, half naked, ragged, without a\\r\\nsign of his kingship on him, stood before the throne and stared with\\r\\nfury at this figure of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king on the throne looked at him. \"Who art thou, and what dost thou\\r\\nhere?\" he asked. And though his voice was just like Robert\\'s own, it had\\r\\nsomething in it sweet and deep, like the sound of bells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the king!\" cried Robert of Sicily. \"I am the king, and you are an\\r\\nimpostor!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courtiers started from their seats, and drew their swords. They\\r\\nwould have killed the crazy man who insulted their king; but he raised\\r\\nhis hand and stopped them, and with his eyes looking into Robert\\'s eyes\\r\\nhe said, \"Not the king; you shall be the king\\'s jester! You shall wear\\r\\nthe cap and bells, and make laughter for my court. You shall be the\\r\\nservant of the servants, and your companion shall, be the jester\\'s ape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith shouts of laughter, the courtiers drove Robert of Sicily from the\\r\\nbanquet hall; the waiting-men, with laughter, too, pushed him into the\\r\\nsoldiers\\' hall; and there the pages brought the jester\\'s wretched ape,\\r\\nand put a fool\\'s cap and bells on Robert\\'s head. It was like a terrible\\r\\ndream; he could not believe it true, he could not understand what had\\r\\nhappened to him. And when he woke next morning, he believed it was a\\r\\ndream, and that he was king again. But as he turned his head, he felt\\r\\nthe coarse straw under his cheek instead of the soft pillow, and he saw\\r\\nthat he was in the stable, with the shivering ape by his side. Robert of\\r\\nSicily was a jester, and no one knew him for the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree long years passed. Sicily was happy and all things went well under\\r\\nthe king, who was not Robert. Robert was still the jester, and his heart\\r\\ngrew harder and more bitter with every year. Many times, during the\\r\\nthree years, the king, who had his face and voice, had called him to\\r\\nhimself, when none else could hear, and had asked him the one question,\\r\\n\"Who art thou?\" And each time that he asked it his eyes looked into\\r\\nRobert\\'s eyes, to find his heart. But each time Robert threw back his\\r\\nhead and answered, proudly, \"I am the king!\" And the other king\\'s eyes\\r\\ngrew sad and stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of three years, the Pope called the Emperor of Allemaine and\\r\\nthe King of Sicily, his brothers, to a great meeting in his city of\\r\\nRome. The King of Sicily went, with all his soldiers and courtiers and\\r\\nservants,--a great procession of horsemen and footmen. Never had there\\r\\nbeen seen a finer sight than the grand train, men in bright armour,\\r\\nriders in wonderful cloaks of velvet and silk, servants, carrying\\r\\nmarvellous presents to the Pope. And at the very end rode Robert, the\\r\\njester. His horse was poor and old, many-coloured, and the ape rode with\\r\\nhim. Every one in the villages through which they passed ran after the\\r\\njester, and pointed and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pope received his brothers and their trains in the square before\\r\\nSaint Peter\\'s. With music and flags and flowers he made the King of\\r\\nSicily welcome, and greeted him as his brother. In the midst of it, the\\r\\njester broke through the crowd and threw himself before the Pope. \"Look\\r\\nat me!\" he cried; \"I am your brother, Robert of Sicily! This man is an\\r\\nimpostor, who has stolen my throne. I am Robert, the king!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pope looked at the poor jester with pity, but the Emperor of\\r\\nAllemaine turned to the King of Sicily, and said, \"Is it not rather\\r\\ndangerous, brother, to keep a madman as jester?\" And again Robert was\\r\\npushed back among the serving-men.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Holy Week, and the king and the emperor, with all their trains,\\r\\nwent every day to the great services in the cathedral. Something\\r\\nwonderful and holy seemed to make these services more beautiful than\\r\\never before. All the people of Rome felt it: it was as if the presence\\r\\nof an angel were there. Men thought of God, and felt His blessing on\\r\\nthem. But no one knew who it was that brought the beautiful feeling. And\\r\\nwhen Easter Day came, never had there been so lovely, so holy a day: in\\r\\nthe great churches, filled with flowers, and sweet with incense, the\\r\\nkneeling people listened to the choirs singing, and it was like the\\r\\nvoices of angels; their prayers were more earnest than ever before,\\r\\ntheir praise more glad; there was something heavenly in Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert of Sicily went to the services with the rest, and sat in the\\r\\nhumblest place with the servants. Over and over again he heard the\\r\\nsweet voices of the choirs chant the Latin words he had heard long ago:\\r\\n_He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted them of\\r\\nlow degree_. And at last, as he listened, his heart was softened. He,\\r\\ntoo, felt the strange blessed presence of a heavenly power. He thought\\r\\nof God, and of his own wickedness; he remembered how selfish he had\\r\\nbeen, and how little good he had done; he realised, that his power had\\r\\nnot been from himself, at all. On Easter night, as he crept to his bed\\r\\nof straw, he wept, not because he was so wretched, but because he had\\r\\nnot been a better king when power was his.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last all the festivities were over, and the King of Sicily went home\\r\\nto his own land again, with his people. Robert the jester came home too.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of their home-coming, there was a special service in the\\r\\nroyal church, and even after the service was over for the people, the\\r\\nmonks held prayers of thanksgiving and praise. The sound of their\\r\\nsinging came softly in at the palace windows. In the great banquet room,\\r\\nthe king sat, wearing his royal robes and his crown, while many subjects\\r\\ncame to greet him. At last, he sent them all away, saying he wanted to\\r\\nbe alone; but he commanded the jester to stay. And when they were alone\\r\\ntogether the king looked into Robert\\'s eyes, as he had done before, and\\r\\nsaid, softly, \"Who art thou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert of Sicily bowed his head. \"Thou knowest best,\" he said, \"I only\\r\\nknow that I have sinned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, he heard the voices of the monks singing, _He hath put down\\r\\nthe mighty from their seat_,--and his head sank lower. But suddenly the\\r\\nmusic seemed to change; a wonderful light shone all about. As Robert\\r\\nraised his eyes, he saw the face of the king smiling at him with a\\r\\nradiance like nothing on earth, and as he sank to his knees before the\\r\\nglory of that smile, a voice sounded with the music, like a melody\\r\\nthrobbing on a single string,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an angel, and thou art the king!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Robert of Sicily was alone. His royal robes were upon him once\\r\\nmore; he wore his crown and his royal ring. He was king. And when the\\r\\ncourtiers came back they found their king kneeling by his throne,\\r\\nabsorbed in silent prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JEALOUS COURTIERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if you have ever heard the anecdote about the artist of\\r\\nDuesseldorf and the jealous courtiers. This is it. It seems there was\\r\\nonce a very famous artist who lived in the little town of Duesseldorf. He\\r\\ndid such fine work that the Elector, Prince Johann Wilhelm, ordered a\\r\\nportrait statue of himself, on horseback, to be done in bronze. The\\r\\nartist was overjoyed at the commission, and worked early and late at the\\r\\nstatue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the work was done, and the artist had the great statue set up in\\r\\nthe public square of Duesseldorf, ready for the opening view. The Elector\\r\\ncame on the appointed day, and with him came his favourite courtiers\\r\\nfrom the castle. Then the statue was unveiled. It was very\\r\\nbeautiful,--so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise. He could\\r\\nnot look enough, and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands\\r\\nwith him, like an old friend. \"Herr Grupello,\" he said, \"you are a great\\r\\nartist, and this statue will make your fame even greater than it is; the\\r\\nportrait of me is perfect!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the courtiers heard this, and saw the friendly hand-shake, their\\r\\njealousy of the artist was beyond bounds. Their one thought was, how\\r\\ncould they safely do something to humiliate him. They dared not pick\\r\\nflaws in the portrait statue, for the prince had declared it perfect.\\r\\nBut at last one of them said, with an air of great frankness, \"Indeed,\\r\\nHerr Grupello, the portrait of his Royal Highness is perfect; but permit\\r\\nme to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful: the\\r\\nhead is too large; it is out of proportion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said another, \"the horse is really not so successful; the turn of\\r\\nthe neck, there, is awkward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you would change the right hind-foot, Herr Grupello,\" said a third,\\r\\n\"it would be an improvement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill another found fault with the horse\\'s tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artist listened, quietly. When they had all finished, he turned to\\r\\nthe prince and said, \"Your courtiers, prince, find a good many flaws in\\r\\nthe statue of the horse; will you permit me to keep it a few days more,\\r\\nto do what I can with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Elector assented, and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be\\r\\nbuilt around the statue, so that his assistants could work undisturbed.\\r\\nFor several days the sound of hammering came steadily from behind the\\r\\nenclosure. The courtiers, who took care to pass that way, often, were\\r\\ndelighted. Each one said to himself, \"I must have been right, really;\\r\\nthe artist himself sees that something was wrong; now I shall have\\r\\ncredit for saving the prince\\'s portrait by my artistic taste!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more the artist summoned the prince and his courtiers, and once\\r\\nmore the statue was unveiled. Again the Elector exclaimed at its beauty,\\r\\nand then he turned to his courtiers, one after another, to see what they\\r\\nhad to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfect!\" said the first. \"Now that the horse\\'s head is in proportion,\\r\\nthere is not a flaw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The change in the neck was just what was needed,\" said the second; \"it\\r\\nis very graceful now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rear right foot is as it should be, now,\" said a third, \"and it\\r\\nadds so much to the beauty of the whole!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth said that he considered the tail greatly improved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My courtiers are much pleased now,\" said the prince to Herr Grupello;\\r\\n\"they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHerr Grupello smiled a little. \"I am glad they are pleased,\" he said,\\r\\n\"but the fact is, I have changed nothing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" said the prince in surprise. \"Have we not heard the\\r\\nsound of hammering every day? What were you hammering at then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was hammering at the reputation of your courtiers, who found fault\\r\\nsimply because they were jealous,\" said the artist. \"And I rather think\\r\\nthat their reputation is pretty well hammered to pieces!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed. The Elector laughed heartily, but the courtiers slunk\\r\\naway, one after another, without a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE CHERRY\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once an old king, so wise and kind and true that the most\\r\\npowerful good fairy of his land visited him and asked him to name the\\r\\ndearest wish of his heart, that she might grant it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely you know it,\" said the good king; \"it is for my only son, Prince\\r\\nCherry; do for him whatever you would have done for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gladly,\" said the great fairy; \"choose what I shall give him. I can\\r\\nmake him the richest, the most beautiful, or the most powerful prince in\\r\\nthe world; choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None of those things are what I want,\" said the king. \"I want only that\\r\\nhe shall be good. Of what use will it be to him to be beautiful, rich,\\r\\nor powerful, if he grows into a bad man? Make him the best prince in the\\r\\nworld, I beg you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alas, I cannot make him good,\" said the fairy; \"he must do that for\\r\\nhimself. I can give him good advice, reprove him when he does wrong, and\\r\\npunish him if he will not punish himself; I can and will be his best\\r\\nfriend, but I cannot make him good unless he wills it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king was sad to hear this, but he rejoiced in the friendship of the\\r\\nfairy for his son. And when he died, soon after, he was happy to know\\r\\nthat he left Prince Cherry in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Cherry grieved for his father, and often lay awake at night,\\r\\nthinking of him. One night, when he was all alone in his room, a soft\\r\\nand lovely light suddenly shone before him, and a beautiful vision stood\\r\\nat his side. It was the good fairy. She was clad in robes of dazzling\\r\\nwhite, and on her shining hair she wore a wreath of white roses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the Fairy Candide,\" she said to the prince. \"I promised your\\r\\nfather that I would be your best friend, and as long as you live I shall\\r\\nwatch over your happiness. I have brought you a gift; it is not\\r\\nwonderful to look at, but it has a wonderful power for your welfare;\\r\\nwear it, and let it help you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she placed a small gold ring on the prince\\'s little\\r\\nfinger. \"This ring,\" she said, \"will help you to be good; when you do\\r\\nevil, it will prick you, to remind you. If you do not heed its warnings\\r\\na worse thing will happen to you, for I shall become your enemy.\" Then\\r\\nshe vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Cherry wore his ring, and said nothing to anyone of the fairy\\'s\\r\\ngift. It did not prick him for a long time, because he was good and\\r\\nmerry and happy. But Prince Cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse\\r\\nwhen he was a child; she had always said to him that when he should\\r\\nbecome king he could do exactly as he pleased. Now, after a while, he\\r\\nbegan to find out that this was not true, and it made him angry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have\\r\\nhis own way was on a day when he went hunting. It happened that he got\\r\\nno game. This put him in such a bad temper that he grumbled and scolded\\r\\nall the way home. The little gold ring began to feel tight and\\r\\nuncomfortable. When he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go away!\" said the prince, crossly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on\\r\\nhis master, and tried to kiss his hand. The prince turned and kicked the\\r\\nlittle creature. At the instant, he felt a sharp prick in his little\\r\\nfinger, like a pin prick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What nonsense!\" said the prince to himself. \"Am I not king of the whole\\r\\nland? May I not kick my own dog, if I choose? What evil is there in\\r\\nthat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA silver voice spoke in his ear: \"The king of the land has a right to do\\r\\ngood, but not evil; you have been guilty of bad temper and of cruelty\\r\\nto-day; see that you do better to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince turned sharply, but no one was to be seen; yet he recognised\\r\\nthe voice as that of Fairy Candide.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe followed her advice for a little, but presently he forgot, and the\\r\\nring pricked him so sharply that his finger had a drop of blood on it.\\r\\nThis happened again and again, for the prince grew more self-willed and\\r\\nheadstrong every day; he had some bad friends, too, who urged him on, in\\r\\nthe hope that he would ruin himself and give them a chance to seize the\\r\\nthrone. He treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly, and\\r\\neverything he wanted he felt that he must have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ring annoyed him terribly; it was embarrassing for a king to have a\\r\\ndrop of blood on his finger all the time! At last he took the ring off\\r\\nand put it out of sight. Then he thought he should be perfectly happy,\\r\\nhaving his own way; but instead, he grew more unhappy as he grew less\\r\\ngood. Whenever he was crossed, or could not have his own way instantly,\\r\\nhe flew into a passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, he wanted something that he really could not have. This time it\\r\\nwas a most beautiful young girl, named Zelia; the prince saw her, and\\r\\nloved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen. To his\\r\\ngreat astonishment, she refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I not pleasing to you?\" asked the prince in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very handsome, very charming, prince,\" said Zelia; \"but you are\\r\\nnot like the good king, your father; I fear you would make me very\\r\\nmiserable if I were your queen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a great rage, Prince Cherry ordered the young girl to be put in\\r\\nprison; and the key of her dungeon he kept. He told one of his friends,\\r\\na wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes, about the thing,\\r\\nand asked his advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not king?\" said the bad friend. \"May you not do as you will?\\r\\nKeep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command, and if she will\\r\\nnot, sell her as a slave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature?\"\\r\\nsaid the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects\\r\\ndared disobey you!\" said the courtier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had cleverly touched the prince\\'s worst trait, his pride. Prince\\r\\nCherry went at once to Zelia\\'s dungeon, prepared to do this cruel thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nZelia was gone. No one had the key save the prince himself; yet she was\\r\\ngone. The only person who could have dared to help her, thought the\\r\\nprince, was his old tutor, Suliman, the only man left who ever rebuked\\r\\nhim for anything. In fury, he ordered Suliman to be put in fetters and\\r\\nbrought before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his servants left him, to carry out the wicked order, there was a\\r\\nclash, as of thunder, in the room, and then a blinding light. Fairy\\r\\nCandide stood before him. Her beautiful face was stern, and her silver\\r\\nvoice rang like a trumpet, as she said, \"Wicked and selfish prince, you\\r\\nhave become baser than the beasts you hunt; you are furious as a lion,\\r\\nrevengeful as a serpent, greedy as a wolf, and brutal as a bull; take,\\r\\ntherefore, the shape of those beasts whom you resemble!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith horror, the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster.\\r\\nHe tried to rush upon the fairy and kill her, but she had vanished with\\r\\nher words. As he stood, her voice came from the air, saying, sadly,\\r\\n\"Learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own\\r\\nsubjects.\" At the same moment, Prince Cherry felt himself being\\r\\ntransported to a distant forest, where he was set down by a clear\\r\\nstream. In the water he saw his own terrible image; he had the head of a\\r\\nlion, with bull\\'s horns, the feet of a wolf, and a tail like a serpent.\\r\\nAnd as he gazed in horror, the fairy\\'s voice whispered, \"Your soul has\\r\\nbecome more ugly than your shape is; you yourself have deformed it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor beast rushed away from the sound of her words, but in a moment\\r\\nhe stumbled into a trap, set by bear-catchers. When the trappers found\\r\\nhim they were delighted to have caught a curiosity, and they immediately\\r\\ndragged him to the palace courtyard. There he heard the whole court\\r\\nbuzzing with gossip. Prince Cherry had been struck by lightning and\\r\\nkilled, was the news, and the five favourite courtiers had struggled to\\r\\nmake themselves rulers, but the people had refused them, and offered the\\r\\ncrown to Suliman, the good old tutor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as he heard this, the prince saw Suliman on the steps of the\\r\\npalace, speaking to the people. \"I will take the crown to keep in\\r\\ntrust,\" he said. \"Perhaps the prince is not dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a bad king; we do not want him back,\" said the people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know his heart,\" said Suliman, \"it is not all bad; it is tainted, but\\r\\nnot corrupt; perhaps he will repent and come back to us a good king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the beast heard this, it touched him so much that he stopped\\r\\ntearing at his chains, and became gentle. He let his keepers lead him\\r\\naway to the royal menagerie without hurting them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife was very terrible to the prince, now, but he began to see that he\\r\\nhad brought all his sorrow on himself, and he tried to bear it\\r\\npatiently. The worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper. At last, one\\r\\nnight, this keeper was in great danger; a tiger got loose, and attacked\\r\\nhim. \"Good enough! Let him die!\" thought Prince Cherry. But when he saw\\r\\nhow helpless the keeper was, he repented, and sprang to help. He killed\\r\\nthe tiger and saved the keeper\\'s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he crouched at the keeper\\'s feet, a voice said, \"Good actions never\\r\\ngo unrewarded!\" And the terrible monster was changed into a pretty\\r\\nlittle white dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court and told the\\r\\nstory, and from then on, Cherry was carefully treated, and had the best\\r\\nof everything. But in order to keep the little dog from growing, the\\r\\nqueen ordered that he should be fed very little, and that was pretty\\r\\nhard for the poor prince. He was often half starved, although so much\\r\\npetted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the\\r\\npalace woods, where he loved to be, when he saw a poor old woman hunting\\r\\nfor roots, and seeming almost starved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor thing,\" he thought, \"she is even more hungry than I\"; and he ran\\r\\nup and dropped the crust at her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman ate it, and seemed greatly refreshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCherry was glad of that, and he was running happily back to his kennel\\r\\nwhen he heard cries of distress, and suddenly he saw some rough men\\r\\ndragging along a young girl, who was weeping and crying for help. What\\r\\nwas his horror to see that the young girl was Zelia! Oh, how he wished\\r\\nhe were the monster once more, so that he could kill the men and rescue\\r\\nher! But he could do nothing except bark, and bite at the heels of the\\r\\nwicked men. That did not stop them; they drove him off, with blows, and\\r\\ncarried Zelia into a palace in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Cherry crouched by the steps, and watched. His heart was full of\\r\\npity and rage. But suddenly he thought, \"I was as bad as these men; I\\r\\nmyself put Zelia in prison, and would have treated her worse still, if I\\r\\nhad not been prevented.\" The thought made him so sorry and ashamed that\\r\\nhe repented bitterly the evil he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a window opened, and Cherry saw Zelia lean out and throw down\\r\\na piece of meat. He seized it and was just going to devour it, when the\\r\\nold woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him\\r\\nin her arms. \"No, you shall not eat it, you poor little thing,\" she\\r\\nsaid, \"for every bit of food in that house is poisoned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment, a voice said, \"Good actions never go unrewarded!\"\\r\\nAnd instantly Prince Cherry was transformed into a little white dove.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith great joy, he flew to the open palace window to seek out his Zelia,\\r\\nto try to help her. But though he hunted in every room, no Zelia was to\\r\\nbe found. He had to fly away, without seeing her. He wanted more than\\r\\nanything else to find her, and stay near her, so he flew out into the\\r\\nworld, to seek her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sought her in many lands, until one day, in a far eastern country, he\\r\\nfound her sitting in a tent, by the side of an old, white-haired hermit.\\r\\nCherry was wild with delight. He flew to her shoulder, caressed her hair\\r\\nwith his beak, and cooed in her ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You dear, lovely little thing!\" said Zelia. \"Will you stay with me? If\\r\\nyou will, I will love you always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Zelia, see what you have done!\" laughed the hermit. At that\\r\\ninstant, the white dove vanished, and Prince Cherry stood there, as\\r\\nhandsome and charming as ever, and with a look of kindness and modesty\\r\\nin his eyes which had never been there before. At the same time, the\\r\\nhermit stood up, his flowing hair changed to shining gold, and his face\\r\\nbecame a lovely woman\\'s face; it was the Fairy Candide. \"Zelia has\\r\\nbroken your spell,\" she said to the prince, \"as I meant she should, when\\r\\nyou were worthy of her love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZelia and Prince Cherry fell at the fairy\\'s feet. But with a beautiful\\r\\nsmile she bade them come to their kingdom. In a trice, they were\\r\\ntransported to the prince\\'s palace, where King Suliman greeted them with\\r\\ntears of joy. He gave back the throne with all his heart, and King\\r\\nCherry ruled again, with Zelia for his queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wore the little gold ring all the rest of his life, but never once\\r\\ndid it have to prick him hard enough to make his finger bleed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLD IN THE ORCHARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard. He was very\\r\\nindustrious, and the farm always prospered under his care. But he knew\\r\\nthat his three sons despised the farm work, and were eager to make\\r\\nwealth fast, through adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the farmer was old, and felt that his time had come to die, he\\r\\ncalled the three sons to him and said, \"My sons, there is a pot of gold\\r\\nhidden in the olive orchard. Dig for it, if you wish it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the\\r\\ngold was hidden; but he would tell them nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the farmer was dead, the sons went to work to find the pot of\\r\\ngold; since they did not know where the hiding-place was, they agreed to\\r\\nbegin in a line, at one end of the orchard, and to dig until one of them\\r\\nshould find the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard\\r\\nto the other, round the tree-roots and between them. But no pot of gold\\r\\nwas to be found. It seemed as if some one must have stolen it, or as if\\r\\nthe farmer had been wandering in his wits. The three sons were bitterly\\r\\ndisappointed to have all their work for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next olive season, the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit\\r\\nthan they had ever given before; the fine cultivating they had had from\\r\\nthe digging brought so much fruit, and of so fine a quality, that when\\r\\nit was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they\\r\\nsuddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he said, \"There\\r\\nis gold hidden in the orchard; dig for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARGARET OF NEW ORLEANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever go to the beautiful city of New Orleans, somebody will be\\r\\nsure to take you down into the old business part of the city, where\\r\\nthere are banks and shops and hotels, and show you a statue which stands\\r\\nin a little square there. It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low\\r\\nchair, with her arms around a child, who leans against her. The woman is\\r\\nnot at all pretty: she wears thick, common shoes, a plain dress, with a\\r\\nlittle shawl, and a sun-bonnet; she is stout and short, and her face is\\r\\na square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you like your\\r\\nmother\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there is something very surprising about this statue: it was the\\r\\nfirst one that was ever made in America in honour of a woman. Even in\\r\\nEurope there are not many monuments to women, and most of the few are to\\r\\ngreat queens or princesses, very beautiful and very richly dressed. You\\r\\nsee, this statue in New Orleans is not quite like anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the statue of a woman named Margaret. Her whole name was Margaret\\r\\nHaughery, but no one in New Orleans remembers her by it, any more than\\r\\nyou think of your dearest sister by her full name; she is just Margaret.\\r\\nThis is her story, and it tells why people made a monument for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Margaret was a tiny baby, her father and mother died, and she was\\r\\nadopted by two young people as poor and as kind as her own parents. She\\r\\nlived with them until she grew up. Then she married, and had a little\\r\\nbaby of her own. But very soon her husband died, and then the baby died,\\r\\ntoo, and Margaret was all alone in the world. She was poor, but she was\\r\\nstrong, and knew how to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day, from morning until evening, she ironed clothes in a laundry.\\r\\nAnd every day, as she worked by the window, she saw the little\\r\\nmotherless children from the orphan asylum, near by, working and\\r\\nplaying about. After a while, there came a great sickness upon the city,\\r\\nand so many mothers and fathers died that there were more orphans than\\r\\nthe asylum could possibly take care of. They needed a good friend, now.\\r\\nYou would hardly think, would you, that a poor woman who worked in a\\r\\nlaundry could be much of a friend to them? But Margaret was. She went\\r\\nstraight to the kind Sisters who had the asylum and told them she was\\r\\ngoing to give them part of her wages and was going to work for them,\\r\\nbesides. Pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money\\r\\nsaved from her wages. With this, she bought two cows and a little\\r\\ndelivery cart. Then she carried her milk to her customers in the little\\r\\ncart every morning; and as she went, she begged the pieces of food left\\r\\nover from the hotels and rich houses, and brought it back in the cart to\\r\\nthe hungry children in the asylum. In the very hardest times that was\\r\\noften all the food the poor children had.\\r\\n\\r\\nA part of the money Margaret earned went every week to the asylum, and\\r\\nafter a few years that was made very much larger and better. Margaret\\r\\nwas so careful and so good at business that, in spite of her giving, she\\r\\nbought more cows and earned more money. With this, she built a home for\\r\\norphan babies; she called it her baby house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time, Margaret had a chance to get a bakery, and then she became\\r\\na bread-woman instead of a milk-woman. She carried the bread just as she\\r\\nhad carried the milk, in her cart. And still she kept giving money to\\r\\nthe asylum. Then the great war came, the Civil War. In all the trouble\\r\\nand sickness and fear of that time, Margaret drove her cart of bread;\\r\\nand somehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers, and for\\r\\nher babies, beside what she sold. And despite all this, she earned\\r\\nenough so that when the war was over she built a big steam factory for\\r\\nher bread. By this time everybody in the city knew her. The children all\\r\\nover the city loved her; the business men were proud of her; the poor\\r\\npeople all came to her for advice. She used to sit at the open door of\\r\\nher office, in a calico gown and a little shawl, and give a good word to\\r\\neverybody, rich or poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, by and by, one day, Margaret died. And when it was time to read\\r\\nher will, the people found that, with all her giving, she had still\\r\\nsaved a great deal of money, and that she had left every penny of it to\\r\\nthe different orphan asylums of the city,--each one of them was given\\r\\nsomething. Whether they were for white children or black, for Jews,\\r\\nCatholics, or Protestants, made no difference; for Margaret always said,\\r\\n\"They are all orphans alike.\" And just think, dears, that splendid,\\r\\nwise will was signed with a cross instead of a name, for Margaret had\\r\\nnever learned to read or write!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the people of New Orleans knew that Margaret was dead, they said,\\r\\n\"She was a mother to the motherless; she was a friend to those who had\\r\\nno friends; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach; we will not\\r\\nlet her memory go from us.\" So they made a statue of her, just as she\\r\\nused to look, sitting in her own office door, or driving in her own\\r\\nlittle cart. And there it stands to-day, in memory of the great love and\\r\\nthe great power of plain Margaret Haughery, of New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DAGDA\\'S HARP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, dears, in the old countries there are many fine stories about\\r\\nthings which happened so very long ago that nobody knows exactly how\\r\\nmuch of them is true. Ireland is like that. It is so old that even as\\r\\nlong ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines, and\\r\\nknew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold, and\\r\\nwho could fight and make laws; but we do not know just where they came\\r\\nfrom, nor exactly how they lived. These people left us some splendid\\r\\nstories about their kings, their fights, and their beautiful women; but\\r\\nit all happened such a long time ago that the stories are mixtures of\\r\\nthings that really happened and what people said about them, and we\\r\\ndon\\'t know just which is which. The stories are called _legends_. One of\\r\\nthe prettiest legends is the story I am going to tell you about the\\r\\nDagda\\'s harp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in\\r\\nIreland: one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes, called\\r\\nFomorians--they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when\\r\\nthey fought--and another race of people who were golden-haired and\\r\\nblue-eyed, and who carried short, blunt, heavy spears of dull metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe golden-haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of\\r\\nhigh priest, who was called the Dagda. And this Dagda had a wonderful\\r\\nmagic harp. The harp was beautiful to look upon, mighty in size, made of\\r\\nrare wood, and ornamented with gold and jewels; and it had wonderful\\r\\nmusic in its strings, which only the Dagda could call out. When the men\\r\\nwere going out to battle, the Dagda would set up his magic harp and\\r\\nsweep his hand across the strings, and a war song would ring out which\\r\\nwould make every warrior buckle on his armour, brace his knees, and\\r\\nshout, \"Forth to the fight!\" Then, when the men came back from the\\r\\nbattle, weary and wounded, the Dagda would take his harp and strike a\\r\\nfew chords, and as the magic music stole out upon the air, every man\\r\\nforgot his weariness and the smart of his wounds, and thought of the\\r\\nhonour he had won, and of the comrade who had died beside him, and of\\r\\nthe safety of his wife and children. Then the song would swell out\\r\\nlouder, and every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped\\r\\nwin for the king; and each man would rise at the great table, his cup in\\r\\nhis hand, and shout \"Long live the King!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a time when the Fomorians and the golden-haired men were at\\r\\nwar; and in the midst of a great battle, while the Dagda\\'s hall was not\\r\\nso well guarded as usual, some of the chieftains of the Fomorians stole\\r\\nthe great harp from the wall, where it hung, and fled away with it.\\r\\nTheir wives and children and some few of their soldiers went with them,\\r\\nand they fled fast and far through the night, until they were a long way\\r\\nfrom the battlefield. Then they thought they were safe, and they turned\\r\\naside into a vacant castle, by the road, and sat down to a banquet,\\r\\nhanging the stolen harp on the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dagda, with two or three of his warriors, had followed hard on their\\r\\ntrack. And while they were in the midst of their banqueting, the door\\r\\nwas suddenly burst open, and the Dagda stood there, with his men. Some\\r\\nof the Fomorians sprang to their feet, but before any of them could\\r\\ngrasp a weapon, the Dagda called out to his harp on the wall, \"Come to\\r\\nme, O my harp!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great harp recognised its master\\'s voice, and leaped from the wall.\\r\\nWhirling through the hall, sweeping aside and killing the men who got in\\r\\nits way, it sprang to its master\\'s hand. And the Dagda took his harp and\\r\\nswept his hand across the strings in three great, solemn chords. The\\r\\nharp answered with the magic Music of Tears. As the wailing harmony\\r\\nsmote upon the air, the women of the Fomorians bowed their heads and\\r\\nwept bitterly, the strong men turned their faces aside, and the little\\r\\nchildren sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the Dagda touched the strings, and this time the magic Music of\\r\\nMirth leaped from the harp. And when they heard that Music of Mirth, the\\r\\nyoung warriors of the Fomorians began to laugh; they laughed till the\\r\\ncups fell from their grasp, and the spears dropped from their hands,\\r\\nwhile the wine flowed from the broken bowls; they laughed until their\\r\\nlimbs were helpless with excess of glee.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more the Dagda touched his harp, but very, very softly. And now a\\r\\nmusic stole forth as soft as dreams, and as sweet as joy: it was the\\r\\nmagic Music of Sleep. When they heard that, gently, gently, the Fomorian\\r\\nwomen bowed their heads in slumber; the little children crept to their\\r\\nmothers\\' laps; the old men nodded; and the young warriors drooped in\\r\\ntheir seats and closed their eyes: one after another all the Fomorians\\r\\nsank into sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all deep in slumber, the Dagda took his magic harp, and\\r\\nhe and his golden-haired warriors stole softly away, and came in safety\\r\\nto their own homes again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a tailor in Galway, and he started out on a journey to go\\r\\nto the king\\'s court at Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not gone far when he met a white horse, and he saluted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the horse. \"Where are you going?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to Dublin,\" said the tailor, \"to build a court for the king\\r\\nand to get a lady for a wife, if I am able to do it.\" For, it seems the\\r\\nking had promised his daughter and a great lot of money to anyone who\\r\\nshould be able to build up his court. The trouble was, that three giants\\r\\nlived in the wood near the court, and every night they came out of the\\r\\nwood and threw down all that was built by day. So nobody could get the\\r\\ncourt built.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you make me a hole,\" said the old white garraun, \"where I could\\r\\ngo in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the\\r\\nkiln, so that they won\\'t see me; for they tire me out doing work for\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do that, indeed,\" said the tailor, \"and welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought his spade and shovel, and he made a hole, and he asked the\\r\\nold white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit\\r\\nhim. The white horse went down into the hole, but when he tried to come\\r\\nup again, he was not able.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a place for me now,\" said the white horse, \"by which I can come up\\r\\nout of the hole here, whenever I am hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not,\" said the tailor; \"remain where you are until I come back,\\r\\nand I\\'ll lift you up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor went forward next day, and the fox met him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you going?\" said the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to Dublin, to try to make a court for the king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you make a place for me where I can hide?\" said the fox. \"The\\r\\nrest of the foxes are always beating me, and they will not allow me to\\r\\neat anything with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do that for you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took his axe and his saw, and he made a thing like a crate, and he\\r\\ntold the fox to get into it so that he could see whether it would fit\\r\\nhim. The fox went into it, and when the tailor had him down, he shut him\\r\\nin. When the fox was satisfied at last that he had a nice place of it\\r\\nwithin, he asked the tailor to let him out, and the tailor answered that\\r\\nhe would not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait there until I come back again,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor went forward the next day, and he had not walked very far\\r\\nwhen he met a lion; and the lion greeted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you going?\" said the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to Dublin to make a court for the king if I am able to make\\r\\nit,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to make a plough for me,\" said the lion, \"I and the other\\r\\nlions could be ploughing and harrowing until we\\'d have a bit to eat in\\r\\nthe harvest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do that for you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought his axe and his saw, and he made a plough. When the plough\\r\\nwas made he put a hole in the beam of it, and got the lion to go in\\r\\nunder the plough so that he might see if he was any good as a\\r\\nploughman. He placed the lion\\'s tail in the hole he had made for it, and\\r\\nthen clapped in a peg, and the lion was not able to draw out his tail\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Loose me now,\" said the lion, \"and we\\'ll fix ourselves and go\\r\\nploughing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor said he would not loose him until he came back himself. He\\r\\nleft him there then, and he came to Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he arrived, he engaged workmen and began to build the court. At the\\r\\nend of the day he had the workmen put a great stone on top of the work.\\r\\nWhen the great stone was raised up, the tailor put some sort of\\r\\ncontrivance under it, that he might be able to throw it down as soon as\\r\\nthe giants came near to it. The workpeople then went home, and the\\r\\ntailor went in hiding behind the big stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the darkness of the night was come, he saw the three giants\\r\\narriving, and they began throwing down the court until they arrived at\\r\\nthe place where the tailor was in hiding up above, and one of them\\r\\nstruck a blow with his sledge on the place where he was. The tailor\\r\\nthrew down the stone, and it fell on him and killed him. The other two\\r\\nwent home then and left all of the court that was remaining without\\r\\nthrowing it down, since their companion was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workmen came again the next day, and they were working until night,\\r\\nand as they were going home the tailor told them to put up the big\\r\\nstone on the top of the work, as it had been the night before. They did\\r\\nthat for him, went home, and the tailor went in hiding the same as he\\r\\ndid the evening before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the people had all gone to rest, the two giants came, and they were\\r\\nthrowing down all that was before them, but as soon as they began, the\\r\\ntailor commenced manoeuvring until he was able to throw down the great\\r\\nstone, so that it fell upon the skull of the giant that was under him,\\r\\nand it killed him. After this there was only the one giant left, and he\\r\\nnever came again until the court was finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen when the work was over, the tailor went to the king and told him to\\r\\ngive him his wife and his money, as he had the court finished; and the\\r\\nking said he would not give him any wife until he had killed the other\\r\\ngiant, for he said that it was not by his strength he had killed the two\\r\\ngiants before, and that he would give him nothing now until he killed\\r\\nthe other one for him. Then the tailor said that he would kill the other\\r\\ngiant for him, and welcome; that there should be no delay at all about\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor went then till he came to the place where the other giant\\r\\nwas, and asked did he want a servant-boy. The giant said he did want\\r\\none, if he could get one who would do everything that he would do\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything that you will do, I will do,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went to their dinner then, and when they had eaten it, the giant\\r\\nasked the tailor \"would he dare to swallow as much boiling broth as\\r\\nhimself.\" The tailor said, \"I will certainly do that, but you must give\\r\\nme an hour before we commence.\" The tailor went out then, and he got a\\r\\nsheepskin, which he sewed up until he made a bag of it, and he slipped\\r\\nit down under his coat. He came in then and told the giant first to\\r\\ndrink a gallon of the broth himself. The giant drank that up while it\\r\\nwas boiling. \"I\\'ll do that,\" said the tailor. He went on until it was\\r\\nall poured into the skin, and the giant thought he had drunk it. The\\r\\ngiant drank another gallon then, and the tailor let another gallon down\\r\\ninto the skin, but the giant thought he was drinking it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do a thing now that you will not dare to do,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not,\" said the giant. \"What is it you would do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a hole and let out the broth again,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do it yourself first,\" said the giant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor gave a prod of the knife, and he let the broth out of the\\r\\nskin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you do that,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said the giant, giving such a prod of the knife into his own\\r\\nstomach that he killed himself. That is the way the tailor killed the\\r\\nthird giant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to the king then, and desired him to send him out his wife and\\r\\nhis money, saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not\\r\\ndo so immediately. They were afraid then that he would throw down the\\r\\ncourt, and they sent the wife to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tailor was a day gone, himself and his wife, they repented and\\r\\nfollowed him to take his wife away from him again. The people who went\\r\\nafter him followed him until they came to the place where the lion was,\\r\\nand the lion said to them, \"The tailor and his wife were here yesterday.\\r\\nI saw them going by, and if you will loose me now, I am swifter than\\r\\nyou, and I will follow them until I overtake them.\" When they heard\\r\\nthat, they released the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lion and the people of Dublin went on, and pursued the tailor, until\\r\\nthey came to the place where the fox was, and the fox greeted them, and\\r\\nsaid, \"The tailor and his wife were here this morning, and if you will\\r\\nloose me, I am swifter than you, and I will follow them, and overtake\\r\\nthem.\" They therefore set the fox free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lion and the fox and the army of Dublin went on then, trying to\\r\\ncatch the tailor, and they kept going until they came to the place\\r\\nwhere the old white garraun was, and the old white garraun told them\\r\\nthat the tailor and his wife were there in the morning, and \"Loose me,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"I am swifter than you, and I\\'ll overtake them.\" They released\\r\\nthe old white garraun then, and the old white garraun, the fox, the\\r\\nlion, and the army of Dublin pursued the tailor and his wife, and it was\\r\\nnot long before they came up with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tailor saw them coming, he got out of the coach with his wife,\\r\\nand he sat down on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old white garraun saw the tailor sitting on the ground, he\\r\\nsaid, \"That\\'s the position he was in when he made the hole for me, that\\r\\nI couldn\\'t get out of, when I went down into it. I\\'ll go no nearer to\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" said the fox, \"but that\\'s the way he was when he was making the\\r\\nthing for me, and I\\'ll go no nearer to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" says the lion, \"but that\\'s the very way he had, when he was making\\r\\nthe plough that I was caught in. I\\'ll go no nearer to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all left him then and returned. The tailor and his wife came home\\r\\nto Galway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE SEA BECAME SALT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story was told long ago by our Northern forefathers who brought it\\r\\nwith them in their dragon ships when they crossed the North Sea to\\r\\nsettle in England. In those days men were apt to invent stories to\\r\\naccount for things about them which seemed peculiar, and loving the sea\\r\\nas they did, it is not strange that they had remarked the peculiarity of\\r\\nthe ocean water and had found a reason why it is so different from the\\r\\nwater in the rivers and steams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not the only story that has come down to tell us how people of\\r\\nold accounted for the sea being salt. There are many such stories, each\\r\\ndifferent from the other, all showing that the same childlike spirit of\\r\\ninquiry was at work in different places, striving to find an answer to\\r\\nthis riddle of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere sprang from the sons of Odin a race of men who became mighty kings\\r\\nof the earth, and one of these, named Frode, ruled over the lands that\\r\\nare called Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about this time were found in Denmark two great millstones, so large\\r\\nthat no one had the strength to turn them. So Frode sent for all the\\r\\nwise men of the land and bade them examine the stones and tell him of\\r\\nwhat use they were, since no one could grind with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after the wise men had looked closely at them and read the magic\\r\\nletters which were cut upon their edge, they said that the millstones\\r\\nwere precious indeed, since they would grind out of nothing anything\\r\\nthat the miller might wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo King Frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two\\r\\nservants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones, and\\r\\nafter a long, long time his messengers found him two maid-servants, who\\r\\nwere bigger and stronger than anyone in Denmark had ever seen. But no\\r\\none guessed that these were really Giant-Maidens who bore a grudge\\r\\nagainst all of the race of Odin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly the Giant-Maidens were brought before Frode, and before they\\r\\nhad rested after their long journey, or satisfied their hunger, he bade\\r\\nthem go to the mill, and grind for him gold and peace and happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"They sang and swung\\r\\n      The swift mill stone,\\r\\n      And with loud voice\\r\\n      They made their moan.\\r\\n      \\'We grind for Frode\\r\\n      Wealth and gold\\r\\n      Abundant riches\\r\\n      He shall behold.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were\\r\\nperforming their task diligently. And as he watched them from the shadow\\r\\nby the door, the maidens stayed their grinding for a while to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greedy man could not bear to see even an instant\\'s pause, and he\\r\\ncame out of the shadow, and bade them, with harsh words, go on grinding,\\r\\nand cease not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent, or while he\\r\\nhimself sang a song. Now it was early summer-time, and the cuckoo was\\r\\ncalling all the day and most of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Giant-Maidens waxed very wroth with King Frode, and as they\\r\\nresumed their labours they sang a song of the hardness of their lot in\\r\\nthe household of this pitiless King.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been grinding out wealth and happiness and peace, but now they\\r\\nbade the magic stones to grind something very different.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, as the great stones moved round and round, Frode, who still\\r\\nstood by, heard one chant in a low, sing-song voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see a fire east of the town--the curlews awake and sound a note of\\r\\nwarning. A host approaches in haste, to burn the dwelling of the king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the next took up her song,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No longer will Frode sit on his throne, and rule over rings of red gold\\r\\nand mighty millstones. Now must we grind with all our might--and,\\r\\nbehold! red warriors come forth--and revenge, and bloodshed, and ruin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Frode shook from head to foot in his terror, for he heard the tramp\\r\\nof a mighty host of warriors advancing from the sea. And as he looked\\r\\nfor a way of escape, the braces of the millstones broke with the strong\\r\\ngrinding, and fell in two. And the whole world shook and trembled with\\r\\nthe mighty shock of that breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut through the crash and din came the voices of the Giant-Maidens,\\r\\nloudly chanting,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We have turned the stone round;\\r\\n      Though weary the maidens,\\r\\n      See what they have ground!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that same night a mighty sea-king came up and slew Frode and\\r\\nplundered his city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had sacked the city, the sea-king took on board his ship the two\\r\\nGiant-Maidens, and with them the broken millstones. And he bade them\\r\\nbegin at once to grind salt, for of this he had very scanty store.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they ground and ground; and in the middle of the night, being weary,\\r\\nthey asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the sea-king was hard of heart, like Frode, and he roughly bade them\\r\\ngo on grinding. And the maidens did so, and worked to such effect that\\r\\nwithin a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the\\r\\nweight of it began to sink the ship. Down, down it sank, ship and giants\\r\\nand millstones, and in that spot, in the very middle of the ocean, arose\\r\\na whirlpool, from whence the salt is carried north and south, east and\\r\\nwest, throughout the waters of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is how the sea became salt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CASTLE OF FORTUNE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne lovely summer morning, just as the sun rose, two travellers started\\r\\non a journey. They were both strong young men, but one was a lazy fellow\\r\\nand the other was a worker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first sunbeams came over the hills, they shone on a great castle\\r\\nstanding on the heights, as far away as the eye could see. It was a\\r\\nwonderful and beautiful castle, all glistening towers that gleamed like\\r\\nmarble, and glancing windows that shone like crystal. The two young men\\r\\nlooked at it eagerly, and longed to go nearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, out of the distance, something like a great butterfly, of\\r\\nwhite and gold, swept toward them. And when it came nearer, they saw\\r\\nthat it was a most beautiful lady, robed in floating garments as fine as\\r\\ncobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell\\r\\nwhether it was of diamonds or of dew. She stood, light as air, on a\\r\\ngreat, shining, golden ball, which rolled along with her, swifter than\\r\\nthe wind. As she passed the travellers, she turned her face to them and\\r\\nsmiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Follow me!\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh. \"She has\\r\\nan easy time of it!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the industrious man ran after the lovely lady and caught the hem of\\r\\nher floating robe in his grasp. \"Who are you, and whither are you\\r\\ngoing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the Fairy of Fortune,\" the beautiful lady said, \"and that is my\\r\\ncastle. You may reach it to-day, if you will; there is time, if you\\r\\nwaste none. If you reach it before the last stroke of midnight, I will\\r\\nreceive you there, and will be your friend. But if you come one second\\r\\nafter midnight, it will be too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had said this, her robe slipped from the traveller\\'s hand and\\r\\nshe was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industrious man hurried back to his friend, and told him what the\\r\\nfairy had said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea!\" said the lazy, man, and he laughed; \"of course, if we had a\\r\\nhorse there would be some chance, but _walk_ all that way? No, thank\\r\\nyou!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then good-bye,\" said his friend, \"I am off.\" And he set out, down the\\r\\nroad toward the shining castle, with a good steady stride, his eyes\\r\\nstraight ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man lay down in the soft grass, and looked rather wistfully at\\r\\nthe far-away towers. \"If only I had a good horse!\" he sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder,\\r\\nand heard a little whinny. He turned round, and there stood a little\\r\\nhorse! It was a dainty creature, gentle-looking, and finely built, and\\r\\nit was saddled and bridled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" said the lazy man. \"Luck often comes when one isn\\'t looking for\\r\\nit!\" And in an instant he had leaped on the horse, and headed him for\\r\\nthe castle of fortune. The little horse started at a fine pace, and in a\\r\\nvery few minutes they overtook the other traveller, plodding along on\\r\\nfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you like shank\\'s pony?\" laughed the lazy man, as he passed his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industrious man only nodded, and kept on with his steady stride,\\r\\neyes straight ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horse kept his good pace, and by noon the towers of the castle stood\\r\\nout against the sky, much nearer and more beautiful. Exactly at noon,\\r\\nthe horse turned aside from the road, into a shady grove on a hill, and\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wise beast,\" said his rider: \"\\'haste makes waste,\\' and all things are\\r\\nbetter in moderation. I\\'ll follow your example, and eat and rest a bit.\"\\r\\nHe dismounted and sat down in the cool moss, with his back against a\\r\\ntree. He had a lunch in his traveller\\'s pouch, and he ate it\\r\\ncomfortably. Then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride, so he\\r\\npulled his hat over his eyes, and settled himself for a nap. \"It will go\\r\\nall the better for a little rest,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat _was_ a sleep! He slept like the seven sleepers, and he dreamed the\\r\\nmost beautiful things you could imagine. At last, he dreamed that he had\\r\\nentered the castle of fortune and was being received with great\\r\\nfestivities. Everything he wanted was brought to him, and music played\\r\\nwhile fireworks were set off in his honour. The music was so loud that\\r\\nhe awoke. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and behold, the fireworks were\\r\\nthe very last rays of the setting sun, and the music was the voice of\\r\\nthe other traveller, passing the grove on foot!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Time to be off,\" said the lazy man, and looked about him for the pretty\\r\\nhorse. No horse was to be found. The only living thing near was an old,\\r\\nbony, grey donkey. The man called, and whistled, and looked, but no\\r\\nlittle horse appeared. After a long while he gave it up, and, since\\r\\nthere was nothing better to do, he mounted the old grey donkey and set\\r\\nout again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe donkey was slow, and he was hard to ride, but he was better than\\r\\nnothing; and gradually the lazy man saw the towers of the castle draw\\r\\nnearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it began to grow dark; in the castle windows the lights began to\\r\\nshow. Then came trouble! Slower, and slower, went the grey donkey;\\r\\nslower, and slower, till, in the very middle of a pitch-black wood, he\\r\\nstopped and stood still. Not a step would he budge for all the coaxing\\r\\nand scolding and beating his rider could give. At last the rider kicked\\r\\nhim, as well as beat him, and at that the donkey felt that he had had\\r\\nenough. Up went his hind heels, and down went his head, and over it went\\r\\nthe lazy man on to the stony ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he lay groaning for many minutes, for it was not a soft place, I\\r\\ncan assure you. How he wished he were in a soft, warm bed, with his\\r\\naching bones comfortable in blankets! The very thought of it made him\\r\\nremember the Castle of Fortune, for he knew there must be fine beds\\r\\nthere. To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor\\r\\nlimbs, so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo donkey was to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen,\\r\\nscratched his hands on the stumps, tore his face in the briers, and\\r\\nbumped his knees on the stones. But no donkey was there. He would have\\r\\nlaid down to sleep again, but he could hear now the howls of hungry\\r\\nwolves in the woods; that it did not sound pleasant. Finally, his hand\\r\\nstruck against something that felt like a saddle. He grasped it,\\r\\nthankfully, and started to mount his donkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beast he took hold of seemed very small, and, as he mounted, he felt\\r\\nthat its sides were moist and slimy. It gave him a shudder, and he\\r\\nhesitated; but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike. It was\\r\\nstriking eleven! There was still time to reach the castle of fortune,\\r\\nbut no more than enough; so he mounted his new steed and rode on once\\r\\nmore. The animal was easier to sit on than the donkey, and the saddle\\r\\nseemed remarkably high behind; it was good to lean against. But even the\\r\\ndonkey was not so slow as this; the new steed was slower than he. After\\r\\na while, however, he pushed his way out of the woods into the open, and\\r\\nthere stood the castle, only a little way ahead! All its windows were\\r\\nablaze with lights. A ray from them fell on the lazy man\\'s beast, and he\\r\\nsaw what he was riding: it was a gigantic snail! a snail as large as a\\r\\ncalf!\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold shudder ran over the lazy man\\'s body, and he would have got off\\r\\nhis horrid animal then and there, but just then the clock struck once\\r\\nmore. It was the first of the long, slow strokes that mark midnight! The\\r\\nman grew frantic when he heard it. He drove his heels into the snail\\'s\\r\\nsides, to make him hurry. Instantly, the snail drew in his head, curled\\r\\nup in his shell, and left the lazy man sitting in a heap on the ground!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck twice. If the man had run for it, he could still have\\r\\nreached the castle, but, instead, he sat still and shouted for a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A beast, a beast!\" he wailed, \"any kind of a beast that will take me to\\r\\nthe castle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck three times. And as it struck the third note, something\\r\\ncame rustling and rattling out of the darkness, something that sounded\\r\\nlike a horse with harness. The lazy man jumped on its back, a very\\r\\nqueer, low back. As he mounted, he saw the doors of the castle open, and\\r\\nsaw his friend standing on the threshold, waving his cap and beckoning\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck four times, and the new steed began to stir; as it\\r\\nstruck five, he moved a pace forward; as it struck six, he stopped; as\\r\\nit struck seven, he turned himself about; as it struck eight, he began\\r\\nto move backward, away from the castle!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man shouted, and beat him, but the beast went slowly backward.\\r\\nAnd the clock struck nine. The man tried to slide off, then, but from\\r\\nall sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up and held him\\r\\nfast. And in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark clouds, he\\r\\nsaw that he was mounted on a monster crab!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one, the lights went out, in the castle windows. The clock struck\\r\\nten. Backward went the crab. Eleven! Still the crab went backward. The\\r\\nclock struck twelve! Then the great doors shut with a clang, and the\\r\\ncastle of fortune was closed for ever to the lazy man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat became of him and his crab no one knows to this day, and no one\\r\\ncares. But the industrious man was received by the Fairy of Fortune, and\\r\\nmade happy in the castle as long as he wanted to stay. And ever\\r\\nafterward she was his friend, helping him not only to happiness for\\r\\nhimself, but also showing him how to help others, wherever he went.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDAVID AND GOLIATH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago, there was a boy named David, who lived in a country in\\r\\nthe Far East. He was good to look upon, for he had fair hair and a ruddy\\r\\nskin; and he was very strong and brave and modest. He was shepherd-boy\\r\\nfor his father, and all day--often all night--he was out in the fields,\\r\\nfar from home, watching over the sheep. He had to guard them from wild\\r\\nanimals, and lead them to the right pastures, and care for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, war broke out between the people of David\\'s country and a\\r\\npeople that lived near at hand; these men were called Philistines, and\\r\\nthe people of David\\'s country were named Israelites. All the strong men\\r\\nof Israel went up to the battle, to fight for their king. David\\'s three\\r\\nolder brothers went, but he was only a boy, so he was left behind to\\r\\ncare for the sheep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the brothers had been gone some time, David\\'s father longed very\\r\\nmuch to hear from them, and to know if they were safe; so he sent for\\r\\nDavid, from the fields, and said to him, \"Take now for thy brothers an\\r\\nephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp,\\r\\nwhere thy brothers are; and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of\\r\\ntheir thousand, and see how thy brothers fare, and bring me word again.\"\\r\\n(An ephah is about three pecks.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and\\r\\ntook the corn and the loaves and the cheeses, as his father had\\r\\ncommanded him, and went to the camp of the Israelites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camp stood on a mountain on the one side, and the Philistines stood\\r\\non a mountain on the other side; and there was a valley between. David\\r\\ncame to the place where the Israelites were, just as the host was going\\r\\nforth to the fight, shouting for the battle. So he left his gifts in the\\r\\nhands of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the army, amongst the\\r\\nsoldiers, to find his brothers. When he found them, he saluted them and\\r\\nbegan to talk with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded,\\r\\nthere arose a great shouting and tumult among the Israelites, and men\\r\\ncame running back from the front line of battle; everything became\\r\\nconfusion. David looked to see what the trouble was, and he saw a\\r\\nstrange sight: down the slope of the opposite mountain came striding a\\r\\nPhilistine warrior, calling out something in a taunting voice; he was a\\r\\ngigantic man, the largest David had ever seen, and he was covered with\\r\\narmour, that shone in the sun: he had a helmet of brass upon his head,\\r\\nand he was armed with a coat of mail, and he had greaves of brass upon\\r\\nhis legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders; his spear was so\\r\\ntremendous that the staff of it was like a weaver\\'s beam, and his shield\\r\\nso great that a man went before him, to carry it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is that?\" asked David.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Goliath, of Gath, champion of the Philistines,\" said the soldiers\\r\\nabout. \"Every day, for forty days, he has come forth, so, and challenged\\r\\nus to send a man against him, in single combat; and since no one dares\\r\\nto go out against him alone, the armies cannot fight.\" (That was one of\\r\\nthe laws of warfare in those times.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" said David, \"does none dare go out against him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, the giant stood still, on the hillside opposite the host\\r\\nof Israel, and shouted his challenge, scornfully. He said, \"Why are ye\\r\\ncome out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and ye\\r\\nservants of Saul? Choose you a man, and let him come down to me. If he\\r\\nbe able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants;\\r\\nbut if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our\\r\\nservants, and serve us. I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a\\r\\nman, that we may fight together!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen King Saul heard these words, he was dismayed, and all the men of\\r\\nIsrael, when they saw the man, fled from him and were sore afraid. David\\r\\nheard them talking among themselves, whispering and murmuring. They were\\r\\nsaying, \"Have ye seen this man that is come up? Surely if anyone killeth\\r\\nhim that man will the king make rich; perhaps he will give him his\\r\\ndaughter in marriage, and make his family free in Israel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid heard this, and he asked the men if it were so. It was surely so,\\r\\nthey said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said David, \"who is this Philistine, that he should defy the\\r\\narmies of the living God?\" And he was stirred with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery soon, some of the officers told the king about the youth who was\\r\\nasking so many questions, and who said that it was shame upon Israel\\r\\nthat a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God.\\r\\nImmediately Saul sent for him. When David came before Saul, he said to\\r\\nthe king, \"Let no man\\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go\\r\\nand fight with this Philistine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Saul looked at David, and said, \"Thou art not able to go against\\r\\nthis Philistine, to fight with him, for thou art but a youth, and he has\\r\\nbeen a man of war from his youth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen David said to Saul, \"Once I was keeping my father\\'s sheep, and\\r\\nthere came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock; and I\\r\\nwent out after the lion, and struck him; and delivered the lamb out of\\r\\nhis mouth, and when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and\\r\\nstruck him, and slew him! Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear;\\r\\nand this Philistine shall be as one of them, for he hath defied the\\r\\narmies of the living God. The Lord, who delivered me out of the paw of\\r\\nthe lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the\\r\\nhand of this Philistine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go,\" said Saul, \"and the Lord be with thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he armed David with his own armour,--he put a helmet of brass upon\\r\\nhis head, and armed him with a coat of mail. But when David girded his\\r\\nsword upon his armour, and tried to walk, he said to Saul, \"I cannot go\\r\\nwith these, for I am not used to them.\" And he put them off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones\\r\\nout of the brook, and put them in a shepherd\\'s bag which he had; and his\\r\\nsling was in his hand; and he went out and drew near to the Philistine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore\\r\\nhis shield went before him. And when the Philistine looked about and saw\\r\\nDavid, he disdained him, for David was but a boy, and ruddy, and of a\\r\\nfair countenance. And he said to David, \"Am I a dog, that thou comest to\\r\\nme with a cudgel?\" And with curses he cried out again, \"Come to me, and\\r\\nI will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of\\r\\nthe field.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut David looked at him, and answered, \"Thou comest to me with a sword,\\r\\nand with a spear, and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of\\r\\nthe Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast\\r\\ndefied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand, and I will\\r\\nsmite thee, and take thy head from thee, and I will give the carcasses\\r\\nof the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and\\r\\nto the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there\\r\\nis a God in Israel! And all this assembly shall know that the Lord\\r\\nsaveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord\\'s, and he\\r\\nwill give you into our hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet\\r\\nDavid, David made haste and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.\\r\\nAnd when he was a little way from him, he put his hand in his bag, and\\r\\ntook from thence a stone, and put it in his sling, and slung it, and\\r\\nsmote the Philistine in the forehead, so that the stone sank into his\\r\\nforehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and\\r\\ndrew it out of its sheath, and slew him with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.\\r\\nBut the army of Israel pursued them, and victory was with the men of\\r\\nIsrael.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after the battle, David was taken to the king\\'s tent, and made a\\r\\ncaptain over many men; and he went no more to his father\\'s house, to\\r\\nherd the sheep, but became a man, in the king\\'s service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHEPHERD\\'S SONG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid had many fierce battles to fight for King Saul against the enemies\\r\\nof Israel, and he won them all. Then, later, he had to fight against the\\r\\nking\\'s own soldiers, to save himself, for King Saul grew wickedly\\r\\njealous of David\\'s fame as a soldier, and tried to kill him. Twice, when\\r\\nDavid had a chance to kill the king, he forbore to harm him; but even\\r\\nthen, Saul continued trying to take his life, and David was kept away\\r\\nfrom his home as if he were an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when King Saul died, the people chose David for their king, because\\r\\nthere was no one so brave, so wise, or so faithful to God. King David\\r\\nlived a long time, and made his people famous for victory and happiness;\\r\\nhe had many troubles and many wars, but he always trusted that God would\\r\\nhelp him, and he never deserted his own people in any hard place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a battle, or when it was a holiday, or when he was very thankful\\r\\nfor something, King David used to make songs, and sing them before the\\r\\npeople. Some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been\\r\\nforgotten. After all these hundreds and hundred of years, we sing them\\r\\nstill; we call them Psalms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, after David had made a song, his chief musician would sing with\\r\\nhim, as the people gathered to worship God. Sometimes the singers were\\r\\ndivided into two great choruses, and went to the service in two\\r\\nprocessions; then one chorus would sing a verse of David\\'s song, and the\\r\\nother procession would answer with the next, and then both would sing\\r\\ntogether; it was very beautiful to hear. Even now, we sometimes do that\\r\\nwith the songs of David in our churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of his Psalms that everybody loves is a song that David made when he\\r\\nremembered the days before he came to Saul\\'s camp. He remembered the\\r\\ndays and nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep, when he\\r\\nwas just a shepherd-boy; and he thought to himself that God had taken\\r\\ncare of him just as carefully as he himself used to care for the little\\r\\nlambs. It is a beautiful song; I wish we knew the music that David made\\r\\nfor it, but we only know his words. I will tell it to you now, and then\\r\\nyou may learn it, to say for yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\\r\\n\\r\\n     He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me\\r\\n     beside the still waters.\\r\\n\\r\\n     He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of\\r\\n     righteousness for his name\\'s sake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of\\r\\n     death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod\\r\\n     and thy staff they comfort me.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine\\r\\n     enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth\\r\\n     over.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my\\r\\n     life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HIDDEN SERVANTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a legend about a hermit who lived long ago. He lived high up on\\r\\nthe mountainside in a tiny cave; his food was roots and acorns, a bit of\\r\\nbread given by a peasant, or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his\\r\\nprayers; his work was praying, and thinking about God. For forty years\\r\\nhe lived so, preaching to the people, praying for them, comforting them\\r\\nin trouble, and, most of all, worshipping in his heart. There was just\\r\\none thing he cared about: it was to make his soul so pure and perfect\\r\\nthat it could be one of the stones in God\\'s great Temple of Heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, after the forty years, he had a great longing to know how far\\r\\nalong he had got with his work,--how it looked to the Heavenly Father.\\r\\nAnd he prayed that he might be shown a man--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown\\r\\n      To the selfsame measure as his own;\\r\\n      Whose treasure on the celestial shore\\r\\n      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he looked up from his prayer, a white-robed angel stood in the path\\r\\nbefore him. The hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness,\\r\\nfor he knew that his wish was answered. \"Go to the nearest town,\" the\\r\\nangel said, \"and there, in the public square, you will find a mountebank\\r\\n(a clown) making the people laugh for money. He is the man you seek; his\\r\\nsoul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own; his treasure on the\\r\\ncelestial shore is neither less than yours nor more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the angel had faded from sight, the hermit bowed his head again,\\r\\nbut this time with great sorrow and fear. Had his forty years of prayer\\r\\nbeen a terrible mistake, and was his soul indeed like a clown, fooling\\r\\nin the market-place? He knew not what to think. Almost he hoped he\\r\\nshould not find the man, and could believe that he had dreamed the angel\\r\\nvision. But when he came, after a long, tiring walk to the village, and\\r\\nthe square, alas! there was the clown, doing his silly tricks for the\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hermit stood and looked at him with terror and sadness, for he felt\\r\\nthat he was looking at his own soul. The face he saw was thin and tired,\\r\\nand though it kept a smile or a grin for the people, it seemed very sad\\r\\nto the hermit. Soon the man felt the hermit\\'s eyes; he could not go on\\r\\nwith his tricks. And when he had stopped and the crowd had left, the\\r\\nhermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest; for\\r\\nhe wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man\\'s soul\\r\\nwas like, because what it was, his was.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, after a little, he asked the clown, very gently, what his life was,\\r\\nwhat it had been. And the clown answered, very sadly, that it was just\\r\\nas it looked,--a life of foolish tricks, for that was the only way of\\r\\nearning his bread that he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But have you never been anything different?\" asked the hermit,\\r\\npainfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clown\\'s head sank in his hands. \"Yes, holy father,\" he said, \"I have\\r\\nbeen something else. I was a thief! I once belonged to the most wicked\\r\\nband of mountain robbers that ever tormented the land, and I was as\\r\\nwicked as the worst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! The hermit felt that his heart was breaking. Was this how he\\r\\nlooked to the Heavenly Father--like a thief, a cruel mountain robber? He\\r\\ncould hardly speak, and the tears streamed from his old eyes, but he\\r\\ngathered strength to ask one more question. \"I beg you,\" he said, \"if\\r\\nyou have ever done a single good deed in your life, remember it now, and\\r\\ntell it to me\"; for he thought that even one good deed would save him\\r\\nfrom utter despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, one,\" the clown said, \"but it was so small, it is not worth\\r\\ntelling; my life has been worthless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me that one!\" pleaded the hermit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once,\" said the man, \"our band broke into a convent garden and stole\\r\\naway one of the nuns, to sell as a slave or to keep for a ransom. We\\r\\ndragged her with us over the rough, long way to our mountain camp, and\\r\\nset a guard over her for the night. The poor thing prayed to us so\\r\\npiteously to let her go! And as she begged, she looked from one hard\\r\\nface to another, with trusting, imploring eyes, as if she could not\\r\\nbelieve men could be really bad. Father, when her eyes met mine\\r\\nsomething pierced my heart! Pity and shame leaped up, for the first\\r\\ntime, within me. But I made my face as hard and cruel as the rest, and\\r\\nshe turned away, hopeless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When all was dark and still, I stole like a cat to where she lay bound.\\r\\nI put my hand on her wrist and whispered, \\'Trust me, and I will take you\\r\\nsafely home.\\' I cut her bonds with my knife, and she looked at me to\\r\\nshow that she trusted. Father, by terrible ways that I knew, hidden from\\r\\nthe others, I took her safe to the convent gate. She knocked; they\\r\\nopened; and she slipped inside. And, as she left me, she turned and\\r\\nsaid, \\'God will remember.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was all. I could not go back to the old bad life, and I had never\\r\\nlearned an honest way to earn my bread. So I became a clown, and must be\\r\\na clown until I die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! my son,\" cried the hermit, and now his tears were tears of joy.\\r\\n\"God has remembered; your soul is in his sight even as mine, who have\\r\\nprayed and preached for forty years. Your treasure waits for you on the\\r\\nheavenly shore just as mine does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As _yours_? Father, you mock me!\" said the clown.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel\\'s\\r\\nanswer, the poor clown was transfigured with joy, for he knew that his\\r\\nsins were forgiven. And when the hermit went home to his mountain, the\\r\\nclown went with him. He, too, became a hermit, and spent his time in\\r\\npraise and prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether they lived, and worked, and helped the poor. And when, after\\r\\ntwo years, the man who had been a clown died, the hermit felt that he\\r\\nhad lost a brother more holy than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut, thinking always\\r\\nof God, fasting and praying, and doing no least thing that was wrong.\\r\\nThen, one day, the wish once more came, to know how his work was\\r\\ngrowing, and once more he prayed that he might see a being--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown\\r\\n      To the selfsame measure as his own;\\r\\n      Whose treasure on the celestial shore\\r\\n      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more his prayer was answered. The angel came to him, and told him\\r\\nto go to a certain village on the other side of the mountain, and to a\\r\\nsmall farm in it, where two women lived. In them he should find two\\r\\nsouls like his own, in God\\'s sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hermit came to the door of the little farm, the two women who\\r\\nlived there were overjoyed to see him, for everyone loved and honoured\\r\\nhis name. They put a chair for him on the cool porch, and brought food\\r\\nand drink. But the hermit was too eager to wait. He longed greatly to\\r\\nknow what the souls of the two women were like, and from their looks he\\r\\ncould see only that they were gentle and honest. One was old, and the\\r\\nother of middle age.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he asked them about their lives. They told him the little\\r\\nthere was to tell: they had worked hard always, in the fields with their\\r\\nhusbands, or in the house; they had many children; they had seen hard\\r\\ntimes,--sickness, sorrow; but they had never despaired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what of your good deeds,\" the hermit asked,--\"what have you done\\r\\nfor God?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very little,\" they said, sadly, for they were too poor to give much. To\\r\\nbe sure, twice every year, when they killed a sheep for food, they gave\\r\\nhalf to their poorer neighbours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very good, very faithful,\" the hermit said. \"And is there any\\r\\nother good deed you have done?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said the older woman, \"unless, unless--it might be called a\\r\\ngood deed----\" She looked at the younger woman, who smiled back at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" said the hermit.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the woman hesitated; but at last she said, timidly, \"It is not\\r\\nmuch to tell, father, only this, that it is twenty years since my\\r\\nsister-in-law and I came to live together in the house; we have brought\\r\\nup our families here; and in all the twenty years there has never been a\\r\\ncross word between us, or a look that was less than kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hermit bent his head before the two women, and gave thanks in his\\r\\nheart. \"If my soul is as these,\" he said, \"I am blessed indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd suddenly a great light came into the hermit\\'s mind, and he saw how\\r\\nmany ways there are of serving God. Some serve him in churches and in\\r\\nhermits\\' cells, by praise and prayer; some poor souls who have been very\\r\\nwicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow, and serve him with\\r\\nrepentance; some live faithfully and gently in humble homes, working,\\r\\nbringing up children, keeping kind and cheerful; some bear pain\\r\\npatiently, for His sake. Endless, endless ways there are, that only the\\r\\nHeavenly Father sees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, as the hermit climbed the mountain again, he thought,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As he saw the star-like glow\\r\\n      Of light, in the cottage windows far,\\r\\n      How many God\\'s hidden servants are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE GOTTLIEB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the North Sea, in a country called Germany, lived a little boy\\r\\nnamed Gottlieb. His father had died when he was but a baby, and although\\r\\nfrom early morning till late at night his mother sat plying her needle,\\r\\nshe found it difficult indeed to provide food and clothing and shelter\\r\\nfor her little boy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nGottlieb was not old enough to work, but he would often sit on a small\\r\\nstool at his mother\\'s feet and dream about the wonderful things he would\\r\\ndo for his dear mother when he grew to be a man, and she was comforted\\r\\nas she looked upon her boy, and the thought that she was working for him\\r\\noften gave strength to her tired fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one night Gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually\\r\\ntroubled. Every now and then she would sigh, and a tear would trickle\\r\\ndown her cheek. The little boy had grown quick to read these signs of\\r\\ndistress, and he thought, \"Christmas will be here soon, and dear mother\\r\\nis thinking of what a sad time it will be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would Gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother! He\\r\\ncould only sit and brood, while his young heart swelled and a lump rose\\r\\nin his throat at the thought that he could do nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, however, a happy fancy came to him. Was not the Christ Child\\r\\nborn on Christmas Day, and did not He send good gifts to men on His\\r\\nbirthday? But then came the thought, \"He will never find us. Our home is\\r\\nso mean and small.\" It seemed foolish to hope, but a boy is not long\\r\\ncast down, and as Gottlieb sat dreaming, a happy inspiration came to\\r\\nhim. Stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen, for he had\\r\\nlearnt to write, and spelt out, word after word, a letter which he\\r\\naddressed to the Christ Child.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be sure that the postman was puzzled what to do with this letter\\r\\nwhen he sorted it out of the heap in the letter-box. Perhaps the\\r\\nBurgomaster would know the right thing to do? So the postman took the\\r\\nletter to the great burly man who lived in the big house and wore a gold\\r\\nchain round his neck. The Burgomaster opened the envelope, and as he\\r\\nread the letter written in the trembling hand of a child, tears came\\r\\ninto his eyes. But he spoke gruffly enough to the postman, \"This must\\r\\nbe a foolish boy; a small one, I have no doubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon Christmas morning dawned, and Gottlieb woke very early. But others\\r\\nwere up before him, for, to his surprise, he saw a strange gentleman\\r\\nwith his mother. His wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual\\r\\nobjects, for the hearth was piled with wood, and the table was loaded\\r\\nwith food and dainties such as he had never even imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\nGottlieb entered the room just as his mother threw herself at the\\r\\nstranger\\'s feet to bless him for his generous goodness to the widow and\\r\\norphan. \"Nay, give me no thanks, worthy dame,\" said the visitor. \"Rather\\r\\nbe grateful to your little son, and to the good Lord to whom he wrote\\r\\nfor aid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he turned to Gottlieb with a smile, \"You see that although you\\r\\nwrote to the Christ Child, your prayer for aid came only to the\\r\\nBurgomaster. The gifts you asked for are here, but they come from my\\r\\nhand.\" But Gottlieb answered him humbly, \"Nay, sir, the Christ Child\\r\\nsent them, for He put the thought in your heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE FIR TREE BECAME THE CHRISTMAS TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you stand round the Christmas tree and look longingly at the toys\\r\\nhanging from the prickly branches, it does not occur to you to ask why\\r\\nit is always this particular tree that is so honoured at Christmas. The\\r\\ndark green Fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up\\r\\nby Christmas candles, that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is\\r\\nthe most modest of trees. But so it is, and because of its humility it\\r\\nwas chosen to bear Christmas gifts to the children. This is the story:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Christ Child was born, all people, animals, trees, and other\\r\\nplants felt that a great happiness had come into the world. And truly,\\r\\nthe Heavenly Father had sent with the Holy Babe His blessings of Peace\\r\\nand Goodwill to all. Every day people came to see the sweet Babe,\\r\\nbringing presents in their hands. By the stable wherein lay the Christ\\r\\nChild stood three trees, and as the people came and went under their\\r\\nspreading branches, they thought that they, too, would like to give\\r\\npresents to the Child.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaid the Palm, \"I will choose my biggest leaf and place it as a fan\\r\\nbeside the manger to waft soft air to the Child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I,\" said the Olive, \"I will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil over Him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I give to the Child?\" asked the Fir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You?\" said the others. \"You have nothing to offer. Your needles would\\r\\nprick the wee Babe, and your tears are sticky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed, and it said, sadly, \"Yes,\\r\\nyou are right. I have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the\\r\\nChrist Child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, quite near to the trees had stood an Angel, who had heard all that\\r\\nhad passed. He was moved to pity the Fir, who was so lowly and without\\r\\nenvy of the other trees, and he resolved to help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle, and\\r\\nthe Angel begged some of the little ones to come down and rest upon the\\r\\nbranches of the Fir. This they were glad to do, and their silvery light\\r\\nshone among the branches just like Christmas candles. From where He lay\\r\\nthe Christ Child could see the great dark evening world and the darker\\r\\nforms of the trees keeping watch, like faithful guardians, beside the\\r\\nopen door of the stable; and to its delight the Fir Tree saw the face of\\r\\nthe Babe illumined with a heavenly smile as He looked upon the twinkling\\r\\nlights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christ Child did not forget the lovely sight, and long afterward he\\r\\nbade that to celebrate His birthday there should be placed in every\\r\\nhouse a Fir Tree, which might be lit up with candles to shine for the\\r\\nchildren as the stars shone for Him on His first birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas not the Fir Tree richly rewarded for its meekness? Surely there is\\r\\nno other tree that shines on so many happy faces!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DIAMOND AND THE DEWDROP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA costly Diamond, that had once sparkled in a lady\\'s ring, lay in a\\r\\nfield amid tall grasses and oxeye daisies.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust above it, was a big Dewdrop that clung timidly to a nodding\\r\\ngrass-blade.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhead, the blazing sun shone in all his noonday glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since the first pink blush of dawn, the modest Dewdrop had gazed\\r\\nfixedly down upon the rich gem, but feared to address a person of such\\r\\nexalted consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, a large Beetle, during his rambles, chanced to espy the\\r\\nDiamond, and he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sire,\" he said, making a low bow, \"permit your humble servant to offer\\r\\nyou greeting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tha--nks,\" responded the Diamond in languid tones of affectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Beetle raised his head from his profound bow, his gaze happened\\r\\nto alight upon the Dewdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A relative of yours, I presume, Sire?\" he remarked affably, waving one\\r\\nof his feelers in the direction of the Dewdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Diamond burst into a rude, contemptuous laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite _too_ absurd, I declare!\" he exclaimed loftily. \"But there, what\\r\\n_can_ you expect from a low, grovelling beetle? Away, sir, pass on! Your\\r\\nvery presence is distasteful to me. The _idea_ of placing ME upon the\\r\\nsame level--in the same family, as a low-born, mean, insignificant,\\r\\nutterly valueless----\" Here the Diamond fairly choked for breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But has he not beauty exactly like your own, Sire?\" the Beetle ventured\\r\\nto interpose, though with a very timid air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BEAU--TY!\" flashed the Diamond, with fine disdain--\"the impudent fellow\\r\\nmerely apes and imitates ME. However, it is some small consolation to\\r\\nremember that \\'Imitation is the sincerest flattery.\\' But, even\\r\\n_allowing_ him to possess it, mere beauty without _rank_ is ridiculous\\r\\nand worthless. A Boat without _water_--a Carriage, but no _horses_--a\\r\\nWell, but never a _winch_: such is beauty without rank and wealth! There\\r\\nis no _real worth_ apart from rank and wealth. Combine Beauty, Rank,\\r\\n_and_ Wealth, and you have the whole world at your feet. Now you know\\r\\nthe secret of the world worshipping ME.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Diamond sparkled and gleamed with vivid, violet flashes, so that\\r\\nthe Beetle was glad to shade his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor Dewdrop had listened silently to all that had passed, and felt\\r\\nso wounded, that at last he wished he never had been born. Slowly a\\r\\nbright tear fell and splashed the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, a Skylark fluttered to the ground and eagerly darted his beak\\r\\nat the Diamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alas!\" he piped, with a great sob of disappointment. \"What I thought to\\r\\nbe a precious dewdrop is only a worthless diamond. My throat is parched\\r\\nfor want of water. I must die of thirst!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really? The world will never get over your loss,\" cruelly sneered the\\r\\nDiamond.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a sudden and noble resolve came to the Dewdrop. Deeply did he repent\\r\\nhis foolish wish. _He could now lay down his life that the life of\\r\\nanother might be saved!_\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May _I_ help you, please?\" he gently asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lark raised his drooping head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my precious, precious friend, if you will, you can save my life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open your mouth then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Dewdrop slid from the blade of grass, tumbled into the parched\\r\\nbeak, and was eagerly swallowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah--well, well!\" pondered the Beetle as he continued his homeward way.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been taught a lesson that I shall not easily forget. Yes, yes!\\r\\nSimple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and\\r\\nunselfishness--and there is no _true_ beauty where these virtues are\\r\\nabsent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

Once there was a little yellow Tulip, and she lived down in a little dark house under the ground. One day she was sitting there, all by herself, and it was very still. Suddenly, she heard a little _tap, tap, tap_, at the door. \"Who is that?\" she said. \"It's the Rain, and I want to come in,\" said a soft, sad, little voice. \"No, you can't come in,\" the little Tulip said. By and by she heard another little _tap, tap, tap_ on the window-pane. \"Who is there?\" she said. The same soft little voice answered, \"It's the Rain, and I want to come in!\" \"No, you can't come in,\" said the little Tulip. Then it was very still for a long time. At last, there came a little rustling, whispering sound, all round the window: _rustle, whisper, whisper_. \"Who is there?\" said the little Tulip. \"It's the Sunshine,\" said a little, soft, cheery voice, \"and I want to come in!\" \"N no,\" said the little Tulip, \"you can't come in.\" And she sat still again. Pretty soon she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the keyhole. \"Who is there?\" she said. \"It's the Sunshine,\" said the cheery little voice, \"and I want to come in, I want to come in!\" \"No, no,\" said the little Tulip, \"you cannot come in.\" By and by, as she sat so still, she heard _tap, tap, tap_, and _rustle, whisper, rustle_, up and down the window-pane, and on the door and at the keyhole. \"_Who is there?_\" she said. \"It's the Rain and the Sun, the Rain and the Sun,\" said two little voices, together, \"and we want to come in! We want to come in! We want to come in!\" \"Dear, dear!\" said the little Tulip, \"if there are two of you, I s'pose I shall have to let you in.\" So she opened the door a little wee crack, and in they came.
